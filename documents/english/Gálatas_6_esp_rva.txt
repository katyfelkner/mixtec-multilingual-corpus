Brethren, in case someone is entangled in some transgression, you who are spiritual, restore such a person with a spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you too be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
Because if someone considers that it is something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
So let each one examine his work, and then he will have reason for pride only in himself and not in another;
because each one will carry his own load.
He who receives instruction in the word shares every good thing with the one who instructs him.
Don't be fooled; God is not mocked. Everything that man sows, he will reap.
For he who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh; but he who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
Let us not tire of doing good, because in due season we will reap, if we do not lose heart.
Therefore, while we have the opportunity, let us do good to all, and especially to those of the family of faith.
Look how big letters I write to you with my own hand.
Those who want to have the go-ahead in the flesh force them to be circumcised only so as not to be persecuted because of the cross of Christ.
For even those who are circumcised do not keep the law; however, they want you to be circumcised to glory in your flesh.
But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
Because [a] neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is worth anything but the new creature.
For all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God.
From now on, no one causes difficulties for me because I carry the marks of Jesus on my body.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
