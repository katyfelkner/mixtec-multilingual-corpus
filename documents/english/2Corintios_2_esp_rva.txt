So I decided in myself not to come to you again with sadness.
Because if I cause them sadness, who will be the one who makes me happy but the one whom I caused sadness?
And although I am confident in all of you that my joy is the same as all of you, I am writing this to you so that when I arrive I will not have sadness because of those for whom I should enjoy.
For I wrote to you in much tribulation and anguish of heart, and with many tears; not to sadden you but to let you know how great my love for you is.
If any one has caused sadness, it has not saddened only me but, to a certain extent (not to exaggerate), all of you.
The rebuke of the majority is enough for said person.
So rather, they should forgive and encourage her, so that she is not consumed by too much sadness.
Therefore, I urge you to reaffirm your love for her.
Because I also wrote to you for this reason, to have proof that you are obedient in everything.
The one that you had forgiven something, me too. For what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sake I have done it in the presence of Christ;
so that we are not deceived by Satan, because we do not ignore his purposes.
When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, although the door had been opened to me in the Lord,
I had no rest in my spirit for not having found my brother Titus. So I said goodbye to them and left for Macedonia.
But thanks be to God who makes us always triumph in Christ and who manifests the smell of his knowledge everywhere through us.
Because for God we are fragrant scent of Christ in those who are saved and in those who are lost.
At some, the smell of death for death; while the others smell of life for life. And for these things, who is enough?
Because we are not, like many, traffickers of the word of God; rather, with sincerity and as from God we speak before God in Christ.
