Once there were three boys and a girl,
and all three fell in love with that girl.
And the girl spoke to each of them
and commanded them to go to the pantheon to watch.
And he said that any boy who was not scared of anything,
he could marry her.
Then the day came when they were going to the pantheon,
and there were all three of them; and then a ghost appeared,
and all three fled.
Then the girl laughed because she had disguised herself as a ghost.
So the next day she returned home.
And he said to those boys
that not one of them was going to marry her,
through his own fault,
because they had been frightened and had fled from the pantheon.
So the three of them asked how he knew
she that the boys had fled.
Then the girl said that
she herself had disguised herself as a ghost,
and all three laughed.
