This is the third time I have come to you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses all matters will be judged.
I said previously, when I was present the second time, and although I am now absent, I say it beforehand to those who previously sinned and also to everyone else, that if I go again, I will not be forgiving,
since you are looking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, who is not weak towards you, but powerful in you.
Because He was certainly crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. So we too are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him by the power of God towards you.
Put yourself to the test to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves. Or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you really do not pass the test?
But I hope you will recognize that we are not disapproved.
And we pray to God that you do nothing wrong; not so that we appear approved, but so that you do what is good, although we appear disapproved.
Because we can do nothing against the truth, but only in favor of the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak, but you are strong; We also pray for this: that you are made perfect.
For this reason I am writing these things to you while you are away, so that when I am present I will not have to use severity according to the authority that the Lord gave me for edification and not for destruction.
For the rest, brothers, rejoice, be perfect, comfort yourselves, be of the same mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
