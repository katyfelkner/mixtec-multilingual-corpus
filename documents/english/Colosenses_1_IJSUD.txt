Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and brother Timothy,
To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ who are in Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love you have for all the saints,
because of the hope that is kept for you in heaven, of which you have already heard by the true word of the gospel,
which has reached you, as well as the whole world; and it also bears fruit and grows in you, from the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth,
as you have learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,
who has also declared your love for us in the Spirit.
Therefore we also, from the day we hear it, we do not stop praying for you and asking that you be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding;
that you may walk worthy of the Lord, pleasing him in everything, bearing fruit in every good work, and growing in the knowledge of God;
strengthened with all power, according to the power of his glory, for all patience and long-suffering, with joy,
giving thanks to the Father who made us fit to participate in the inheritance of the saints in light;
who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,
in whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins.
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
For by him all things were created, those in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible; be thrones, be dominions, be principalities, be powers; everything was created through him and for him.
And he is before all things, and by him all things subsist;
and he is the head of the body which is the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in everything he has the preeminence,
because the Father was pleased that all fullness should dwell in him,
and through him to reconcile with himself all things, both those on earth and those in heaven, making peace through the blood of his cross.
You too, who were once estranged and were enemies in your mind because of your evil deeds, have now reconciled you
in his body of flesh through death, to present you holy, and without blemish, and blameless before him.
If you really remain grounded and firm in the faith, and without moving from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which is preached to every creature that is under heaven; of which I, Pablo, was made a minister.
Now I rejoice in what I suffer for you, and I fill in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ in favor of his body, which is the church;
of which I was made a minister, according to the commission of God that was given to me as regards you, to fulfill the word of God;
that is, the mystery that had been hidden for centuries and generations, but that has now been revealed to his saints,
God wanted to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
to whom we announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, in order to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;
For this I also work, fighting according to his strength, which acts in me powerfully.
