As for this help for the saints, it hurts me to write
for I am aware of your prompt disposition, for which I boasted of you among those of Macedonia: "Achaia has been prepared since last year." And your zeal has served as a stimulus for many.
But I have sent these brothers so that our pride in you is not in vain in this respect, and so that you are prepared, as I have been saying.
Lest, if some Macedonians come with me and find them unprepared, we (if not you) will be ashamed for having had this confidence.
That is why I have considered it convenient to exhort the brothers to come to you in advance and prepare first the generosity of you previously promised, so that it is ready as a sign of generosity and not as a requirement.
And I say this: He who sows sparingly will reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
Each one give as he proposed in his heart, not with sadness or obligation because God loves the cheerful giver.
And God is mighty to cause all grace to abound in you, so that, having always in everything all that is necessary, you may abound for every good work;
as it is written: Scattered; gave to the poor. His justice remains forever [a].
He who gives seed to the sower and bread to eat will provide and multiply your seed and increase the fruits of your righteousness.
This, so that they are enriched in everything for all liberality, which produces thanksgiving to God through us.
Because ministering this sacred service not only supplies what is lacking to the saints, but also results in abundant thanksgiving to God.
In experiencing this help, they will glorify God for their obedience to the gospel of Christ, and for their liberality in contributing to them and to all.
Furthermore, by their prayer on your behalf, they show that they love you because of the overwhelming grace of God in you.
Thank God for his unspeakable gift!
