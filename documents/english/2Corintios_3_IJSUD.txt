Do we start again to recommend ourselves? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation for you, or recommendation of yours?
Our letter is you, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
being manifest that you are a letter of Christ issued by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on tables of flesh of the heart.
And such trust we have through Christ towards God.
Not that we are capable by ourselves to think something of ourselves, but that our capacity is of God;
the one who also made us servants capable of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit, because the letter kills, but the spirit vivifies.
And if the ministry of death engraved on stones was with glory, so much so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was fading,
How could the ministry of the spirit not be rather glorious?
For if the ministry of condemnation was with glory, much more will the ministry of justice abound in glory.
For even what was glorious is not glorious in this regard, compared to the exalted glory.
For if what perished had glory, much more will be the glory of what remains.
So, having such hope, we speak very frankly;
and not like Moses, who put a veil over his face, so that the children of Israel would not fix their eyes on the end of what was fading.
But their understanding was dulled, because to this day, when they read the old testament, they have the same undiscovered veil, which is removed by Christ.
And even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is placed over their hearts.
But when they convert to the Lord, the veil will be removed.
Because the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
Therefore, we all, looking at the naked face as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are transformed from glory to glory in the same likeness, as by the Spirit of the Lord.
