God, having spoken long ago, on many occasions and in many ways to the parents by the prophets,
in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son, whom he made heir of all things, through whom he also made the universe.
He is the radiance of his glory and the exact expression of his nature, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. After carrying out the purification of sins, he sat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
being much better than the angels, for he has inherited a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the angels did God ever say: You are my son, I have begotten you today; and again: I will be Father to Him, and He will be Son to me?
And again, when he brings the Firstborn into the world, he says: And worship all the angels of God.
And of the angels he says: He who makes his angels, spirits, and his ministers, calls of fire.
But of the Son he says: Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever, and a scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.
You have loved justice and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with oil of joy more than your companions.
And: You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;
They will perish, but you remain; and they will all grow old like a garment,
and like a cloak you will roll them up; like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never end.
But to which of the angels has he ever said: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to serve for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
