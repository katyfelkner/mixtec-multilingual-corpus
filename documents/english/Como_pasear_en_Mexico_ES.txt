How to walk in Mexico
The first time I came to Mexico I felt very ugly,
because there were many cars and everything was very dangerous,
and I did not understand why there were so many streets.
To me all the streets seemed the same; but it's not like that
Zama si zuhva calle ta vehe cun cuii Ã±i cuhva caa si.
When I came to Mexico the first time, it was very difficult for me to walk.
Little by little I got to know Mexico better and got to know the streets.
Then I knew where I was going
It was not until a month after I arrived that I began to get to know the streets and then I was able to walk alone.
When two months had passed, I was no longer afraid. After three months I was able to go anywhere I wanted.
But if you only have a month there, you don't know very well. You can lose or a car can kill you.
You cannot cross in the middle of the block, because there are many cars.
They pass almost touching each other. If a car kills someone, who knows if the ambulance would come to take them to the hospital
It is very difficult to walk in Mexico, because it is very dangerous.
You need to know very well, because if not, you can lose and there are many people in Mexico.
If you forget one of the streets, you will not be able to get home
But if you already have time in Mexico, then it is no longer difficult.
This is what happened to me when I arrived in Mexico the first time.
but then I got used to it.
