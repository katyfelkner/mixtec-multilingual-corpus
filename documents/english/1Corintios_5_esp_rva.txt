Certainly you hear that there is sexual immorality among you, and an immorality such as not even among the Gentiles is tolerated; So much so that there are those who have their father's wife.
And you are inflated with pride! Would it not have been preferable to cry, so that the one who has committed such an action would be expelled from among you?
Although I am certainly absent in the body, I am present in the spirit. I have already judged, as if present, the one who has done such a thing.
In the name of our Lord Jesus, gathered together you and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus,
deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little leaven leavens the whole dough?
Get rid of the old yeast, so that you are a new dough, as they really are without yeast; because Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed.
So let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread, of sincerity and truth.
I have written to you by letter not to associate with sexual immorality.
I am not referring absolutely to those of this world who are sexual immoral, greedy, swindlers or idolaters, because in such a case it would be necessary for them to leave the world.
But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who, calling himself a brother, is sexual immoral, miser, idolater, slanderer, drunkard, or swindler. With such a person do not even eat.
Well, why do I have to judge those who are outside? Don't they judge those inside?
For those who are outside, God will judge. But remove the wicked from among you.
