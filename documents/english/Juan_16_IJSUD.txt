These things I have spoken to you, so that you will not stumble.
You will be expelled from the synagogues; and the hour is still coming when anyone who kills you will think that they render service to God.
And they will do this to you because they have known neither the Father nor me.
But I have told you this so that when the time comes, you will remember that I had told you. This I did not tell you at the beginning, because I was with you.
But now I am going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me: Where are you going?
Rather, because I have told you these things, sadness has filled your heart.
But I tell you the truth: It is in your best interest that I leave; for if I do not go, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send it to you.
And when he comes, he will rebuke the world about sin, and about justice and judgment.
About sin, because they do not believe in me;
and about justice, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more;
and about judgment, because the prince of this world has already been judged.
I still have many things to tell you, but now you cannot bear them.
But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth; For he will not speak for himself, but whatever he hears will speak, and will tell you things to come.
He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and make it known to you.
Everything the Father has is mine; That is why I said that he will take what is mine and will let you know.
A little more, and you will not see me; and again a little bit, and you will see me, because I am going to the Father.
Then some of his disciples said to each other: What is this that he says to us: A little more, and you will not see me; and again a little bit, and you will see me; And why am I going to the Father?
So they said: What is this that says: A little more? We do not understand what he speaks.
And Jesus understood that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them: Do you ask among yourselves what I said: A little more, and you will not see me, and again a little, and you will see me?
Verily, verily, I say to you, you will weep and lament, and the world will rejoice; and although you will be sad, your sadness will become joy.
When a woman gives birth, she is in pain, because her time has come; but after she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for the joy that a man has been born in the world.
You too now certainly have sadness; But I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.
And on that day you won't ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.
Until now you have asked nothing in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
These things I have spoken to you in parables; The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but will clearly announce to you about the Father.
In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not tell you that I will pray to the Father for you,
for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and believed that I came from God.
I left the Father and have come into the world; again I leave the world and go to the Father.
His disciples said to him: Behold, now you speak clearly, and you speak no parable.
Now we understand that you know all things, and you don't need anyone to ask you; This is why we believe that you have come from God.
Jesus answered them: Now do you believe?
Behold, the hour is coming, and has already come, in which you will be scattered each to his own and you will leave me alone; but I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
These things I have spoken to you so that in me you have peace. In the world you will have affliction. But trust; I have overcome the world.
