Where do wars and conflicts come from? Do they not come from your passions that fight in your members?
You covet and you don't have, that's why you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain, that's why you fight and make war. You do not have, because you do not ask.
You ask and you do not receive, because you ask with evil purposes, to spend it on your pleasures.
O adulterous souls! Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity towards God? Therefore, he who wants to be a friend to the world becomes an enemy of God.
Or do you think Scripture says in vain: He jealously longs for the Spirit who has made us dwell?
But He gives more grace. That is why it says: GOD RESISTS THE PROUD BUT GRACES THE HUMBLE.
Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil, then, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Clean your hands, sinners; and you double-minded, purify your hearts.
Grieve, lament and cry; May your laughter turn to tears and your joy to sadness.
Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and He will exalt you.
Brothers, do not speak ill of each other. He who speaks ill of a brother or judges his brother, speaks ill of the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a fulfillment of the law, but a judge of it.
There is only one giver of the law and judge, who is powerful to save and destroy; but you, who are you who judge your neighbor?
Hear now, you who say: Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city and we will spend a year there, we will do business and we will have profit.
However, you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then fades away.
Rather, you should say: If the Lord wants, we will live and do this or that.
But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is bad.
Therefore, to those who know how to do good and do not do it, it is a sin.
