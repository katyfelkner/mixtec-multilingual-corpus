Paul, Silas and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We must always thank God for you, brothers, as it is worthy, because your faith grows greatly and each one's love for others abounds;
So much so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God because of your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you are enduring.
This gives evident evidence of the just judgment of God, so that they are considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which they are also suffering.
In fact, it is right before God to repay with affliction those who afflict them
and to give with rest, together with us, to you who are afflicted. This will happen when the Lord Jesus with his mighty angels manifests from heaven
in a flame of fire to give retribution to those who have not known God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
They will be punished with eternal perdition, excluded from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,
when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints and to be admired by all who believed; because our testimony has been believed among you.
To this end we always pray for you: that our God may make you worthy of his calling and that he fulfill every good purpose and every work of faith with power.
so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
