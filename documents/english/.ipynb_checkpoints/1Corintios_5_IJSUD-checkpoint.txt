Truly it is heard that there is fornication among you, and such fornication which is not even named among the Gentiles, to the extent that someone has his father's wife.
And you are puffed up, instead of being saddened, so that he who did such a thing might be removed from your midst.
And I certainly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, and as if I were present, have judged the one who has committed this.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, united you and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
such be delivered to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole dough?
So cleanse yourselves of the old leaven so that you may be a new mass, as you are, without leaven, because our Passover, which is Christ, has already been sacrificed for us.
So let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread, of sincerity and truth.
I have written to you by letter that you do not go with the fornicators;
I do not mean in general with all the fornicators of this world, nor with all the misers, the swindlers or the idolaters, because in such a case it would be necessary for you to leave the world.
Rather, I have written to you so that you do not go around with anyone who, calling himself a brother, is a fornicator, or miser, or idolater, or cursing, or drunk or swindler, with such or even eat.
Well, why should I judge those who are outside? Do not you judge the ones inside?
For those who are outside, God will judge. So remove that wicked one from among you.
