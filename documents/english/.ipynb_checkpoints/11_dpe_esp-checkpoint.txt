The Superior Chamber, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, has determined that the courts must issue resolutions promptly, completely and impartially, within the terms and terms established by law.
The guarantee of access to electoral justice for indigenous peoples and their communities should be understood as:
Obtaining a sentence issued by state courts.
The resolution of the problem.
The due motivation and justification of the resolution.
The execution of the judicial sentence.
The effectiveness of the administration of electoral justice must be translated into the issuance of sentences without exaggerated and unnecessary formalities.
