Do not judge, for not being judged.
For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure with which you measure, it will be measured to you.
And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, and you do not realize the beam that is in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, "Let me get the speck out of your eye," when the beam is in your eye?
Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give the holy to the dogs, nor throw your pearls before the pigs, lest they stamp them with their paws, and turning you to pieces.
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Because everyone who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to the caller it will be opened.
Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone,
or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake?

You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes picked from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?
Thus every good tree bears good fruit; but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So by their fruits you will know them.
Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me in that day: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name did we cast out demons, and in your name did we perform many miracles?"
And then I will declare to them: "I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, THOSE WHO PRACTICE INIQUITY."
Therefore, anyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock;
and the rain fell, the torrents came, the winds blew and hit that house; but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand;
and the rain fell, the torrents came, the winds blew and hit that house; and it fell, and great was its destruction.
When Jesus finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching;
for he taught them as one who has authority, and not as his scribes.
