As for what was sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
If anyone thinks they know something, they have not yet learned how to know it;
but if anyone loves God, that one is known to Him.
Therefore, as for eating what has been sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is only one God.
Because although there are some so-called gods, either in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
However, for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things proceed and we are for Him; and a Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and through whom we exist.
However, not everyone has this knowledge; but some, being used to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and his conscience, being weak, is stained.
But food will not recommend us to God, because we are neither less if we do not eat, nor are we more if we eat.
But be careful, lest your freedom somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
For if anyone sees you, who have knowledge, sitting at the table in an idol temple, will not his conscience be stimulated, if he is weak, to eat what has been sacrificed to idols?
And for your knowledge the one who is weak will be lost, the brother for whom Christ died.
And so, by sinning against the brothers and hurting their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I cause my brother to stumble.
