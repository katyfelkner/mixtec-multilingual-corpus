And it came to pass in those days that an edict came out from Augustus Caesar, that all the land should be registered.
This first enumeration was made when Cirenio was governor of Syria.
And they all went to be registered, each one to his city.
So Joseph of Galilee went up from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
to be registered with Maria, his wife, married to him, the one who was pregnant.
And it came to pass that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
And there were shepherds in the same region, who kept watch and kept the night watches over their flocks.
And behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord surrounded them with brightness; and they were greatly afraid.
But the angel said to them: Do not be afraid, for behold, I give you news of great joy, which will be for all the people:
that a Savior, who is CHRIST the Lord, was born to you today in the city of David.
And this will serve as a sign: You will find the child wrapped in diapers, lying in a manger.
And suddenly a multitude of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying:
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men!
And it came to pass that when the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Let us therefore go to Bethlehem, and see what has happened and what the Lord has revealed to us.
And they came quickly and found Mary, and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger.
And when they saw him, they made known what they had been told about the boy.
And all who heard it marveled at what the shepherds said to them.
But Mary kept all these things, meditating on them in her heart.
And the shepherds turned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, as they had been told.
And when the eight days were finished to circumcise the boy, they called his name JESUS, which had been given to him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
And when the days of her purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
(as it is written in the law of the Lord: Every man who opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord),
and to give the offering according to what is said in the law of the Lord: a pair of turtledoves or two pigeons.
And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man, just and pious, awaited the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
And he had received revelation from the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he saw the Christ of the Lord.
And moved by the Spirit, he came to the temple. And when the parents brought the child Jesus to the temple, to do for him according to the custom of the law,
so he took him in his arms and blessed God and said:
Now, Lord, you dismiss your servant in peace, according to your word,
because my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples;
light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory of your people Israel.
And Joseph and his mother were amazed at the things that were said about him.
And Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary: Behold, this child has been set up for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be contradicted;
and a sword will pierce your very soul, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed.
Ana was also there, a prophetess, daughter of Fanuel, from the tribe of Aser, very old, and had lived with her husband for seven years since her virginity;
and she was a widow eighty-four years ago, and did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fasts and prayers.
And this one, arriving at the same hour, thanked the Lord and spoke of the child to all those who expected redemption in Jerusalem.
After they had fulfilled all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their city of Nazareth.
And the child grew, and was strengthened and filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
And his parents went to Jerusalem every year on the feast of the passover.
And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the festival.
And when the days were over, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem, without knowing Joseph and his mother.
And thinking that he was among those in the group, they walked one day; and they sought him out among relatives and acquaintances;
but when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for him.
And it came to pass that three days afterward they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors of the law, hearing them and asking them questions.
And everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his responses.
And when they saw him, they marveled; And his mother said to him: Son, why have you done this to us? Behold, your father and I have looked for you with anguish.
Then he said to them: Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that it is necessary for me to be in my Father's affairs?
But they did not understand the words he spoke to them.
And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.
And Jesus grew in wisdom, and in stature and in grace towards God and men.
