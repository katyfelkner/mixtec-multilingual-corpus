If I spoke human and angelic languages, but I have no love, I have become like a metal that resounds or a cymbal that rattles.
And if I had the gift of prophecy, and understood all the mysteries and all knowledge, and if I had all the faith to move mountains, but I have no love, I am nothing.
And if I gave all my goods to feed the poor, and if I gave my body to be burned, but I have no love, it is of no use to me.
Love is patient, it is kind; love is not envious; love is not boastful, it is not arrogant;
does not behave improperly; does not seek his own, is not irritated, does not take into account the evil received;
he does not rejoice in injustice, but rejoices with the truth;
he suffers everything, he believes everything, he hopes for everything, he endures everything.
Love never stops being; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will end; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will end.
Because in part we know, and in part we prophesy;
but when the perfect comes, the incomplete will end.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; But when I became a man, I left things as a child.
Because now we see through a mirror, veiled, but then we will see face to face; I now know in part, but then I will know fully, as I have been known.
And now faith, hope and love remain, these three; But the greatest of these is love.
