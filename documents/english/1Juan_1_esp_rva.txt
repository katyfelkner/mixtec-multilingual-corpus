What it was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we contemplate and touch our hands with regard to the Word of life
—Life was manifested, and we have seen it; and we witnessed and announced the eternal life that was with the Father and was manifested to us—
what we have seen and heard we also announce to you, so that you too may have communion with us. And our communion is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
We write these things [a] so that our [b] joy is complete.
And this is the message we have heard from him and announce: God is light, and in him there is no darkness.
If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with each other and the blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all evil.
But if we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us.
