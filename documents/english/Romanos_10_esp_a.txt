Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.
Because I testify in their favor that they are jealous of God, but not according to full knowledge.
For, disregarding the justice of God and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to the justice of God.
Because Christ is the end of the law for justice to everyone who believes.
Because Moses writes that the man who practices the justice that is of the law will live by it.
But the justice that is of faith says thus: DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART: "WHO WILL RISE TO HEAVEN?" (that is, to bring Christ down),
or "WHO WILL DESCEND TO THE ABYSS?" (that is, to raise Christ from the dead).
But what does it say? NEAR YOU IS THE WORD, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART, that is, the word of faith that we preach:
that if you confess Jesus with your mouth for Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved;
because with the heart it is believed for justice, and with the mouth it is confessed for salvation.
For the Scripture says: EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED.
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the Lord himself is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call upon him;
for: EVERYONE WHO INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher?
And how will they preach if they are not sent? As it is written: HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO ANNOUNCE THE GOSPEL OF GOOD!
However, not everyone listened to the gospel, because Isaiah says: LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR ADVERTISEMENT?
So faith comes from hearing, and hearing, through the word of Christ.
But I say, have they never heard? Certainly yes: THROUGHOUT THE EARTH HIS VOICE HAS COME OUT, AND HIS WORDS TO THE END OF THE WORLD.
And I add: Did Israel not know? First of all, Moses says: I WILL BRING YOU TO HEAVEN WITH A PEOPLE THAT IS NOT A PEOPLE; WITH A PEOPLE WITH NO UNDERSTANDING I WILL TAKE YOU TO IRA.
And Isaiah is very bold, and says: I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME; I REVEALED THEMSELVES TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK ABOUT ME.
But as for Israel, it says: ALL DAY I HAVE STRETCHED MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND REBELLIOUS PEOPLE.
