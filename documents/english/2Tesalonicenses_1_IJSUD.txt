Paul, and Silvano and Timoteo, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We must always thank God for you, brothers, as is fair, because your faith grows a lot, and the love of each one of you towards others abounds;
So much so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure.
This is a demonstration of the just judgment of God, so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.
Because it is just for God to pay with tribulation to those who trouble you;
and to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven with his mighty angels,
in a flame of fire, to give retribution to those who do not know God, nor obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ;
those who will be punished with eternal perdition, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,
when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all who have believed (because our testimony has been believed among you).
Therefore, likewise, we always pray for you, so that our God may consider you worthy of the call, and fill with goodness every good attempt, and every powerful work of faith,
so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
