Let every soul submit to the superior authorities, because there is no authority except from God, and those that exist are ordained by God.
So whoever opposes authority resists what God has ordained; and those who resist carry condemnation to themselves.
Because the magistrates are not to instill fear in the one who does good, but in the evil. Would you have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it;
because he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, fear; for it is not in vain that he carries the sword, for he is the servant of God, an avenger to punish the one who does evil.
Therefore it is necessary that you be subject to it, not only because of anger, but also because of conscience.
Well, for this you also pay tributes, because they are servants of God who dedicate themselves to this.
Pay everyone what you owe: tribute to whom tribute; to which tax, tax; to whom fear, fear; who honors, honors.
Do not owe anyone anything except loving one another, because he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
Because: You will not commit adultery; you will not kill; you will not steal; you will not give false testimony; you will not covet; and if there is any other commandment, in these words it is summed up: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
Love does no harm to neighbor; so the fulfillment of the law is love.
And this, knowing the time, that it is time to get up from sleep, because now our salvation is closer to us than when we believed.
The night has advanced, and the day is approaching. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.
Let's walk like daylight, honestly; not in gluttony and drunkenness, nor in lewdness and debauchery, nor in lawsuits and envy;
but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and ignore the lusts of the flesh.
