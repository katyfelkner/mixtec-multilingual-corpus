Public Electoral Defender for Indigenous Peoples and Communities
In recent years, the Electoral Tribunal has made progress in protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and communities, placing greater emphasis on the need to judge with an intercultural perspective. This helped electoral judges to effectively protect the rights of indigenous peoples and their members, including the right to self-determination; in addition to providing the widest guarantee and protection of the rights of access to justice, defense and hearing.
To facilitate effective access to justice, the Electoral Tribunal created the Electoral Public Defender for Indigenous Peoples and Communities, whose objective is to facilitate and bring indigenous citizens, under equal conditions, access to the courts, to reduce legal disadvantages and seek effective judicial protection through free advisory and defense services in electoral matters in favor of the peoples, indigenous communities and people who integrate them, recognizing at all times the constitutional right to assistance through interpreters and defenders who have knowledge of the various languages ​​and cultures.
