What existed from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have contemplated and what our hands have felt, about the Word of life
(for life was manifested, and we have seen it and we bear witness and announce to you eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us);
what we have seen and heard, we also proclaim to you, so that you too may have communion with us; and in truth our communion is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
We write these things to you so that our joy may be complete.
And this is the message that we have heard from Him and that we announce to you: God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
If we say that we have communion with Him, but we walk in darkness, we lie and we do not practice the truth;
but if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of sins and to cleanse us from all evil.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and his word is not in us.
