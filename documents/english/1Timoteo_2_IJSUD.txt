I therefore urge, above all, that prayers, prayers, requests and thanksgivings be made for all men,
for the kings and for all who are in eminence, so that we live quietly and restfully in all piety and honesty.
Because this is good and pleasant before God our Savior,
He who wants all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.
Because there is only one God, and only one mediator between God and men, Jesus Christ man,
who gave himself a ransom for all, of which he bore witness in due course.
For this I was made a preacher and an apostle (I tell the truth in Christ, I do not lie), teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
So I want men to pray everywhere, raising holy hands, without anger or strife.
Likewise, that women also dress in decent clothing, with modesty and modesty; not with ostentatious hairstyles, or gold, or pearls or expensive dresses,
but with good works, as befits women who profess godliness.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
Because I do not allow women to teach or exercise dominion over men, but to be silent.
Because Adam was formed first, then Eve;
and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, committed transgression.
Nevertheless, he will be saved by begetting children, if he remains in faith, love and holiness, with modesty.
