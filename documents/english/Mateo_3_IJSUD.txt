And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
For this is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, when he said: Voice of the one crying out in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, straighten his paths.
And John was dressed in camel's hair and had a leather belt around his back; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the province around the Jordan came to him;
and they were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
And when he saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to his baptism, he said to them: O generation of vipers! Who has taught you to flee from the wrath to come?
Therefore bear fruit worthy of repentance,
and do not think to say within yourselves: we have Abraham as father; because I tell you that God can raise children even from these stones to Abraham.
Now the ax is already at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but the one who comes after me, whose shoes I am not worthy to wear, is more powerful than me; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
His winnower is in his hand, and will cleanse his age; and he will gather his wheat in the storehouse and burn the straw with a fire that will never go out.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
But John stopped him, saying: I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?
But Jesus answering said to him: Allow it now, because it is convenient for us to fulfill all justice. Then he allowed it.
And Jesus, after he was baptized, immediately came up out of the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
And behold, a voice from heaven saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
