Brothers, the desire of my heart, and my prayer to God for Israel is for salvation.
Because I testify to you that you are zealous for God, but not according to a full knowledge.
For, ignoring the justice of God and seeking to establish their own justice, they have not submitted to the justice of God.
For the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness to everyone who believes.
Moses writes of the justice that is by law: The man who does these things will live by them [a].
But the righteousness that is by faith says thus: Do not say in your heart, "Who will ascend to heaven?" [B] (that is, to bring Christ down)
nor "Who will descend into the abyss?" [c] (that is, to raise Christ from the dead).
Rather, what does it say ?: The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart [d]. This is the word of faith that we preach:
that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and if you believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Because with the heart it is believed for justice, and with the mouth confession is made for salvation.
For the Scripture says: Everyone who believes in him will not be ashamed [e].
Because there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, because the same who is Lord of all is rich towards all who invoke him.
For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved [f].
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe the one they have not heard of? And how can they hear without a preacher?
And how will they preach without being sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim the gospel of good things! [G].
But not everyone obeyed the gospel, because Isaiah says: Lord, who has believed our message? [H].
For this, faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ [i].
But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course! Their voice has gone out through all the earth; and to the ends of the world, his words [j].
But I ask: Did Israel not understand? Moses was the first to say: I will provoke you to jealousy with a people that is not mine; with a nation without understanding I will provoke you to anger [k].
Isaiah also dares to say: I was found among those who did not seek me; I manifested myself to those who did not ask for me [l].
But about Israel he says: All day long I extended my hands to a disobedient and rebellious people [m].
