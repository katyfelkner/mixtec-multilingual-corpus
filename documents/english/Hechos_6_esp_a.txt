In those days, as the number of the disciples multiplied, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the native Jews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution of food.
Then the twelve called together the congregation of the disciples, and said: It is not convenient for us to neglect the word of God to serve tables.
Therefore, brothers, choose from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, to whom we can entrust this task.
And we will give ourselves to prayer and the ministry of the word.
The proposal had the approval of the entire congregation, and they chose Esteban, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Felipe, Prócoro, Nicanor, Timón, Parmenas and Nicolás, a proselyte from Antioch;
whom they presented before the apostles, and after praying, they laid their hands on them.
And the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and many of the priests obeyed the faith.
And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
But some of the synagogue called the Freedmen, including both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.
But they could not resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
Then they secretly persuaded some men to say: We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and falling on him, they seized him and brought him before the council.
And they presented false witnesses who said: This man continually speaks against this holy place and the law;
Because we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place, and will change the traditions that Moses bequeathed to us.
And as they fixed their eyes on him, all who were sitting on the council saw his face as the face of an angel.
