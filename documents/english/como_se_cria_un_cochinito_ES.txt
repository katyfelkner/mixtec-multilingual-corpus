How to raise a little pig
Some time ago I bought a two-month-old pig and started giving him corn to eat.
When he was twenty days with me, he was already quite big and very pretty
so I kept giving him corn to eat.
When he was two and a half months old, I picked him up and started giving him a liter of corn in the morning, another one at noon, and another one in the afternoon.
So it got very nice and when he was five months old I killed him.
I called my wife to help me.
We hold his hands and legs very well and then lay him down on the floor.
Then I grabbed a knife and stuck it into his neck. So he died and a lot of blood came out.
Then I put a pot on a burner and heated water in it. Then we started to remove her hair very well. We clean it well and then we grab it between the two of us and put it on the table.
I peeled the leather very well and 10 we started to tear; Then I put it in a saucepan on the stove and there it started to roast. After the chicharr√≥n was roasted, a lot of butter came out. They came out like two and a half cans.
Also the meat was very good and very fat. And from that little pig, thirty-eight and a half kilos of meat came out.
