And I saw another sign in heaven, great and admirable: seven angels who had the seven last plagues, because in them the wrath of God is consummated.
And I saw also like a sea of ​​glass mixed with fire, and those who had achieved victory over the beast and its image, and its mark and the number of its name, standing on the sea of ​​glass, with the harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are your works, Lord God Almighty; fair and true are your ways, King of the saints.
Who will not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? Because only you are holy; therefore all nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous judgments have been made manifest.
And after these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in heaven;
And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean and shining linen, and girded around the chest with golden bands.
And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
And the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God and of his power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
