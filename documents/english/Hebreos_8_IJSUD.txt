Now the main point of what we have been saying is that we have such a high priest, who sat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
minister of the sanctuary and of that true tabernacle that the Lord raised, and not the man.
Because every high priest is constituted to present offerings and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary that it also has something to offer.
So if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, with priests still presenting offerings according to the law;
those who serve what is the figure and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to erect the tabernacle, saying: See, do all things according to the pattern that has been shown to you on the mount.
But now so much the better ministry is his, since he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.
Because if that first covenant had been without defect, no place would have been sought for the second.
For rebuking them he says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
not like the covenant I made with their parents the day I took them by the hand to get them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not remain in my covenant, and I ignored them, says the Lord.
Therefore, this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
And no one will teach his neighbor, nor any to his brother, saying: Know the Lord, because all will know me, from the least to the greatest of them.
For I will be merciful in regard to their iniquities, and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.
When he says: New covenant, he has deemed the first one old; and what is considered old and grows old is close to disappearing.
