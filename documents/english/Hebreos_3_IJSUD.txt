Therefore, holy brothers, participants in the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Jesus Christ,
who is faithful to the one who constituted him, as was Moses in all his house.
For he is esteemed as worthy of greater glory than Moses, even as he who built the house has greater honor than the house itself.
For every house is built by someone; but the one who made all things is God.
And Moses was truly faithful over all the house of God, as a servant, as a testimony of what was to be said;
but Christ, as a son, was faithful over the house of God, whose house we are, if until the end we firmly hold the confidence and the glory of hope.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: If you would hear his voice today,
do not harden your hearts as in provocation, on the day of temptation in the desert,
where your parents tempted me; They put me to the test, and they saw my works forty years.
Because of which I was angry with that generation, and said: They always wander in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.
So I swore in my anger, They will not enter into my rest.
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief to depart from the living God.
Rather, exhort one another daily, as long as what is called today lasts, so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
Because we are made partakers of Christ, provided we hold firm to the end the beginning of our confidence,
meanwhile it is said: If you were to hear his voice today, do not harden your hearts, as in provocation.
Because some of those who had left Egypt with Moses, having heard, provoked him, but not all.
And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who did not obey?
And we see that they could not enter because of their unbelief.
