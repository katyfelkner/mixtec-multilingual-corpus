And so we, as collaborators, also exhort you to not receive in vain the grace of God;
because he says: In a favorable time I listened to you, and on the day of salvation I helped you [a]. Behold now the most favorable time! Behold now the day of salvation!
We do not give anyone a chance to stumble over anything so that our ministry is not discredited.
Rather, in everything we present ourselves as ministers of God: in much perseverance, in tribulations, in need, in anguish,
in scourging, in jails, in riots, in hard labor, in sleeplessness, in fasting,
in purity, in knowledge, in tolerance, in goodness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love,
in word of truth, in the power of God, by means of weapons of justice to the right and to the left;
for honor and dishonor, for bad name and good name; as deceivers but being real men;
as not known but well known; as if dying but behold we live; as punished but not dead;
as saddened but always joyful; as poor but enriching many; like having nothing but possessing everything.
Our mouth has been frank with you, O Corinthians; our heart is open.
They are not limited in us; they are in their own hearts.
Well, to correspond in the same way, as I speak to children: Open your hearts too!
Do not unequally yoke with unbelievers. For what fellowship does righteousness have with disorder? What communion does light have with darkness?
What harmony is there between Christ and Belial [b]? What part does the believer have with the non-believer?
What agreement can there be between a temple of God and idols? For we are [c] temple of the living God, as God said: I will dwell and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people [d].
Wherefore, come out from among them, and depart! says the Lord. Do not touch the impure, and I will receive you [e],
and I will be to you Father, and you will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.
