And so we, as collaborators together with him, also exhort you not to receive in vain the grace of God
(because it says: In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you; behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation).
We do not give anyone any reason for atrocity, so that our ministry is not reviled.
Rather, we recommend ourselves in all things as God's ministers, in much patience, in distress, in need, in anguish,
in scourging, in jails, in riots, in work, in sleeplessness, in fasting;
in haste, in knowledge, in bonganimity, in goodness, in the Holy Spirit, in disguised way;
in word of truth, in the power of God, with weapons of justice left and right;
for honor and dishonor, for bad name and for good name; as deceivers, but truthful;
as unknown, but well known; as dying, but behold, we live; as punished, but not dead;
as saddened, but always joyful; like apobres, but blessing many; as having nothing, but possessing everything.
Our mouth has opened to you, O Corinthians; our hearts have widened.
You are not limited by us, but you are limited by your own heart.
Well, to correspond in the same way (as I speak to children), broaden your heart as well.
Do not join in unequal yoke with unbelievers, because what does justice have in common with injustice? And what fellowship does the bluz have with the darkness?
And what harmony does Christ have with aBelial? Or what part does the believer have with the unbeliever?
And what agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For you are the example of the living God, as God said: I will dwell and harm among them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
Wherefore come out from among them, and be separate, says the Lord, and touch not unclean thing; and I will receive you,
and I will be to you Father, and you will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.
