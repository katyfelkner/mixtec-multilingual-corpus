For this reason I exhort, above all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men;
for the kings and for all those who are in eminence, so that we may lead a calm and restful life in all piety and dignity.
This is good and acceptable before God our Savior,
who wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
Because there is only one God and only one mediator between God and men, Jesus Christ man,
who gave himself a ransom for all, of which he bore witness in due course.
For this I was made a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. I say the truth; I do not lie.
So I want men to pray everywhere, raising pious hands, without anger or discussion.
Likewise, that women dress in decent clothing, with modesty and prudence; not with glitzy hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive dresses
but rather with good works, as it is fitting for women who profess reverence for God.
The woman learns with tranquility, with all subjection;
because I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise dominion over the man [a] but to be calm.
For Adam was first formed; then Eva.
Furthermore, Adam was not deceived but the woman, being deceived, committed transgression.
However, you will be saved by having children if you remain in faith, love, and holiness wisely.
