But the Spirit clearly says that in recent times some will turn away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons.
With hypocrisy they will speak lies, having their conscience seared.
They will forbid to marry and they will order to abstain from the foods that God created so that, with thanksgiving, those who believe and have known the truth participate in them.
Because everything that God has created is good, and nothing should be rejected when it is received with thanksgiving
for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
If you expose these things to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and good doctrine, which you have followed closely.
Throw away the profane and old fables, and exercise yourself for godliness.
Because physical exercise is of little use; but piety takes advantage of everything because it has promise for the present life and for the one to come.
Faithful is this word and worthy of all acceptance.
Because for this very reason we work hard and fight, because we hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially those who believe.
These things command and teach.
No one has your youth in little; but be an example to believers in word, in conduct, in love [a], in faith and in purity.
In the meantime I am engaged in reading, exhortation, and teaching.
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which has been given to you by means of prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the council of elders.
Dedicate yourself to these things; Take care of them so that your progress is evident to everyone.
Be careful of yourself and of the doctrine; persist in it, because by doing this you will save yourself and those who listen to you.
