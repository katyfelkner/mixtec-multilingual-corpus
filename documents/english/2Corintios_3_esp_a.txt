Do we start again to recommend ourselves? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation for you or from you?
You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,
being manifest that you are a letter of Christ written by us, not written in ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
And this trust we have towards God through Christ:
not that we are enough in ourselves to think that anything comes from us, but that our sufficiency is from God,
which also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; because the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
And if the ministry of death engraved on stones was with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was fading,
How can the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?
For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of justice abound in glory.
For in truth, what had glory, in this case has no glory by reason of the glory that surpasses it.
For if what fades away is with glory, much more is what remains with glory.
Having therefore such hope, we speak very frankly,
and we are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel would not fix their eyes on the end of that which was to vanish.
But their understanding hardened; for to this day, in the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains un lifted, for only in Christ is it removed.
And to this day, every time Moses is read, a veil is placed over their hearts;
but when anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
But we all, with our faces uncovered, contemplating the glory of the Lord in a mirror, we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.
