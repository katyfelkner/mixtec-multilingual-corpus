The old man to the beloved Gaius, whom I truly love.
Beloved, I pray that you will prosper in everything as your soul prospers, and that you be in good health.
Well, I was very happy when some brothers came and bore witness to your truth, that is, how you walk in the truth.
I have no greater joy than this: hearing that my children walk in the truth.
Beloved, you are acting faithfully in what you do for the brothers, and especially when it comes to strangers;
for they bear witness to your love before the church. You will do well to help them continue their journey in a God-worthy way.
For they went out for the love of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
Therefore, we must welcome such men, so that we are collaborators in favor of the truth.
I wrote something to the church, but Diotrefes, who likes to be the first among them, does not accept what we say.
For this reason, if I go, I will draw attention to the works he does, accusing us unjustly with malicious words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brothers, forbids those who want to do so and expels them from the church.
Beloved, do not imitate evil, but good. He who does good is of God; He who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has a good testimony from everyone and from the truth itself; we also bear witness and you know that our witness is true.
I had many things to write to you, but I don't want to write them to you in pen and ink,
Well I hope to see you soon and we will talk face to face.
Peace be with you. Friends greet you. Say hello to friends, each by name.
