I have told you these things so that you will not stumble.
You will be expelled from the synagogues; but the hour is coming when anyone who kills you will think that in this way they render a service to God.
And they will do these things because they have known neither the Father nor me.
But I have told you these things so that when the time comes, you will remember that I had already spoken about them. And I didn't tell you these things at first, because I was with you.
But now I am going to the one who sent me, and none of you asks me: "Where are you going?"
But because I have told you these things, sadness has filled your heart.
But I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away; because if I do not go, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send it to you.
And when He comes, He will convince the world of sin, of justice and of judgment;
of sin, because they don't believe in me;
of justice, because I go to the Father and you will see me no more;
and of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
I still have many things to tell you, but now you cannot bear them.
But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth, because He will not speak on His own, but will speak everything He hears, and He will tell you what is to come.
He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and make it known to you.
Everything the Father has is mine; That is why I said that He takes what is mine and will make it known to you.
A little more, and you will no longer see me; and again a little, and you will see me.
Then some of his disciples said to each other: What is this that says to us: "A little more, and you will not see me, and again a little, and you will see me" and "Because I am going to the Father"?
So they said: What is this that says: "A little"? We do not know what he is talking about.
Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them: Are you arguing among yourselves about this, because I said: "A little more, and you will not see me, and again a little, and you will see me"?
Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; You will be sad, but your sadness will become joy.
When the woman is about to give birth, she is in distress, because her time has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for the joy that a child was born in the world.
Therefore now you also have sorrow; But I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.
On that day you will not ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you: if you ask the Father for something, he will give it to you in my name.
Until now you have asked nothing in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will speak to you of the Father clearly.
On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not tell you that I will pray to the Father for you,
for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and believed that I came from the Father.
I left the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.
His disciples * said to him, "Behold, now you speak clearly and do not use figurative language.
Now we understand that you know all things, and you don't need anyone to ask you; This is why we believe that you came from God.
Jesus answered them: Now do you believe?
Look, the hour is coming, and it has already come, in which you will be scattered, each one on his own, and you will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
These things I have spoken to you so that in me you have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but trust me, I have overcome the world.
