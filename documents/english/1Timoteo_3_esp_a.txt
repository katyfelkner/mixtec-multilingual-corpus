Faithful word is this: If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he wants to do a good deed.
A bishop must be, therefore, irreproachable, the husband of one woman, sober, prudent, of decent conduct, hospitable, apt to teach,
not given to drink, not quarrelsome, but kind, not contentious, not greedy.
That he governs his house well, having his children subject with all dignity
(for if a man does not know how to run his own house, how can he take care of God's church?);
not a new convert, lest he be puffed up and fall into the damnation into which the devil fell.
He must also have a good reputation among those outside the church, lest he fall into disrepute and the devil's bond.
In the same way, deacons must also be worthy of a single word, not given to much wine, nor lovers of dishonest profits,
but keeping the mystery of faith with a clear conscience.
May these also be tested first, and if they are blameless, then serve as deacons.
Similarly, women must be worthy, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in everything.
May deacons be husbands of one wife, and may they rule their children and their own houses well.
For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves an honorable position and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon,
but in case I am late, I am writing so that you know how one should conduct oneself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, column and supporter of the truth.
And indisputably, great is the mystery of piety: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, contemplated by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed in the world, received above in glory.
