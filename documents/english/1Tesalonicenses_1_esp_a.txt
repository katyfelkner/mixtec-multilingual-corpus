Paul, Silvano and Timoteo, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
We always thank God for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers;
keeping constantly in mind before our God and Father your work of faith, your work of love and the firmness of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ;
knowing, beloved brothers of God, his choice of you,
for our gospel did not come to you only in words, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; As you know what kind of people we show ourselves to be among you out of love for you.
And you came to be imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word, in the midst of much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
so that you became an example to all believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
Because coming out of you, the word of the Lord has resounded, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also everywhere your faith in God has spread, so that we have no need to speak anything.
Well, they themselves tell about us, about the welcome we received from you, and how you turned from idols to God to serve the living and true God,
and wait from heaven for his Son, whom he raised from the dead, that is, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
