For the rest, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may advance and be glorified as it was among you,
and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked men, because faith is not everyone's.
But faithful is the Lord, who will strengthen you and keep you from evil.
And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you do and will do what we have commanded you.
And the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the patience of Christ.
But we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to separate yourself from every brother who walks disorderly, and not according to the teaching they received from us.
Because you yourselves know how you should imitate us, because we did not walk disorderly among you,
nor did we eat anyone's bread for nothing; but we work hard and weary at night and day, not to be burdensome to any of you;
not because we did not have authority, but to give us an example, so that you would imitate us.
Because even when we were with you, we sent you this: That if anyone does not want to work, he should not eat either.
Because we hear that some of you are disorderly, not working on anything, but meddling in what is foreign.
And to those we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that, working calmly, eat their own bread.
But you, brothers, do not tire of doing good.
And if anyone does not obey our word by letter, point him out, and do not join him, to be ashamed.
But do not consider him an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
And may the Lord of Peace himself always give you peace in all circumstances. The Lord be with you all.
This greeting is from my own hand, from Pablo, who is the sign in every letter of mine; so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
