How tortillas are made
When we plant corn, it takes ten to twelve months to get the ear.
First the land is cleaned and the garbage is burned. Then fallow by hand or with oxen.
The land is stirred with the team and then the furrows are made with the plow.
Once the furrows have been made, planting begins with a coa.
When all the milpitas do not come out, it is necessary to re-sow where they did not come out.
As the cornfields grow, the land is cleared once. After a month it is cleaned a second time.
When the ear begins to sprout, it can be pinched and ear tortillas are made.
Then the jilotes come out, which when growing are called elotes. These can be pinched and made into tamales, or corn tortillas.
The ear can be pinched when the cornfield dries; the ears that will be used as seed the other year are separated, but they are kept next to the others in the troje.
How tortillas are made: First, the cob is removed from the kernel and shelled.
Then the corn that is shelled is cooked. Add some lime to the water and wait until the corn is cooked. Then it is removed from the fire.
When the corn cools, it is washed and taken to the mill to make the dough.
Back in the house with the dough, the tortillas are made.
The tortillas that are being made are put on the comal for them to cook. When they are ready they can be eaten.
