As for what was sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.
And if anyone imagines that they know something, they still don't know anything as they should.
But if anyone loves God, he is known to him.
As for eating what is sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is only one God.
Because although there are some who are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
we have only one God, the Father, of whom all things are, and we of him; and a Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.
But not everyone has this knowledge, because some, accustomed up to now to idols, eat food as if it were sacrificed to idols; and his conscience, being weak, is contaminated.
Although food does not make us more acceptable to God, because neither because we eat we will be more, nor because we do not eat we will be less.
But see that this freedom of yours is not a stumbling block for those who are weak.
For if anyone sees you, who have knowledge, that you are sitting at the table in a place of idols, will not the conscience of him who is weak be encouraged to eat of what is sacrificed to idols?
And by your knowledge the weak brother for whom Christ died will perish.
In this way, therefore, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food is a chance for my brother to fall, I will never eat meat so as not to trip my brother.
