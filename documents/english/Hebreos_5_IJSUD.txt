For every high priest, taken from among men, is constituted in behalf of men as regards God, to present offerings and sacrifices for sins,
and he can sympathize with the ignorant and misguided, since he too is surrounded by weaknesses;
and because of them he must, both for himself and for the people, present offerings for sins.
And no one takes this honor for himself, but he who is called by God, as Aaron was.
Likewise, Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but the one who said to him: You are my Son, I have begotten you today.
As it also says elsewhere: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.
He who in the days of his flesh, offering prayers and supplications with great cry and tears to the one who could deliver him from death, was heard because of his reverent fear.
And although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered;
and having been perfected, he became the author of eternal salvation for all who obey him;
appointed by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Of whom we have much to say, and it is difficult to explain, because you have been slow to hear.
Because having already been teachers after so long, you need to be taught again what are the first principles of the words of God; and you have become such that you need milk, and not solid food.
Because everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of justice, because he is a child;
but solid food is for those who have reached maturity, for those who by habit have their senses exercised in the discernment of good and evil.
