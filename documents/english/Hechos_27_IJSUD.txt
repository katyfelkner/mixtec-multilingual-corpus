When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, Pablo and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julio of the Augusta company.
And, embarking on an Adramitan ship, we set sail, with us being Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, to navigate the coasts of Asia.
The next day we arrived at Sidon; and Julio, treating Pablo humanely, allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for by them.
And sailing from there, we sailed under the protection of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
And having crossed the sea in front of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Mira, the city of Lycia.
And when the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, he embarked us on it.
Sailing slowly many days, and having barely reached Gnido, because the wind prevented us, we sailed in the shelter of Crete, in front of Salmon.
And costing it with difficulty, we arrived at a place called Good Ports, near which was the city of Lasea.
And having passed a long time, and navigation being dangerous, because the fast had already passed, Paul admonished them,
saying to them: Males, I see that the navigation is going to be with danger and a lot of loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our people.
But the centurion believed the pilot and the captain of the ship more than what Pablo said.
And since the port was not comfortable for wintering, most agreed to set sail from there too, in case they could arrive at Fenice, which is a port of Crete that faces northwest and southwest, and winter there.
And gently blowing the south wind, seeming to them that they already had what they wanted, they set anchor and went near the coast of Crete.
But not long after, a hurricane-force wind called Euroclidón hit the ship.
And when the ship was snatched, and unable to face the wind, we let ourselves drift.
And having sailed under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, ​​we could hardly hold the skiff;
and once this was on board, they used reinforcements to gird the ship; and fearing that they would strike the sands of Sirte, they lowered the sails and were adrift.
But being hit by a raging storm, the next day they began to lighten the ship.
And on the third day, with their own hands, they threw the rigging of the ship.
And with neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and beset by a no small storm, we had already lost all hope of saving ourselves.
Then Paul, since we had not eaten for a long time, standing in their midst, said: It would have been really convenient, men, to have heard me and not set sail from Crete, in order to avoid this danger and loss.
But now I urge you to be of good cheer, for none of your lives will be lost, but only the ship.
Because tonight the angel of the God of who I am and whom I serve has been with me,
saying: Paul, do not fear; you must appear before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all who sail with you.
Therefore, men, be of good cheer, for I trust God that it will be as I have been told.
However, it is necessary that we give on an island.
And on the fourteenth night, and being carried across the Adriatic Sea, at midnight the sailors suspected that they were near some land.
And casting the probe, they found twenty fathoms; and going a little further, they took the probe again and found fifteen fathoms.
And fearing to stumble, they dropped four anchors at the stern, and wished it were daylight.
Then the sailors attempted to flee the ship; and throwing the skiff into the sea, they looked as if they wanted to drop the anchors at the bow.
But Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers: If they do not remain on the ship, you cannot be saved.
The soldiers then cut the mooring lines of the skiff and allowed it to be lost.
And when it began to be daytime, Paul exhorted everyone to eat, saying: This is the fourteenth day that you keep watch and fast, eating nothing.
Therefore, I beg you to eat for your health, because not even a hair on the head of any of you will perish.
And having said this, he took the bread and thanked God in the presence of all; and breaking it, he began to eat.
So everyone, having better spirits, ate too.
And there were all of us in the ship two hundred and seventy-six.
And satisfied, they lightened the ship, throwing the wheat into the sea.
And when it was daylight, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay that had a beach, in which they agreed to beach the ship, if they could.
Cutting the anchors, then, they left them in the sea, also removing the ties from the rudders; They hoisted the bow sail to the wind and headed for the beach.
But striking a gabled place, they ran the ship aground; and the bow, swollen, remained motionless, and the stern broke open with the force of the sea.
Then the soldiers agreed to kill the prisoners, so that none escaped by swimming.
But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, prevented that attempt, and ordered that those who knew how to swim lie down first and go ashore;
and the rest, part in tables, part in things of the ship. And so it happened that everyone was saved by going ashore.
