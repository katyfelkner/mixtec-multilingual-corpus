Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your lusts, which fight in your members?
You covet, and you have not; you kill and burn with envy, and you cannot reach; You fight and you fight, but you don't have what you want, because you don't ask.
You ask, and you do not receive, because you ask badly, to spend on your lusts.
Adulterers and adulterers, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Anyone, therefore, who wants to be a friend to the world, becomes an enemy of God.
Or do you think Scripture says in vain: He jealously longs for the spirit that dwells in us?
But he gives more grace. That is why it says: God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
Submit yourselves therefore to God; resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Sinners, cleanse your hands; and you, double-minded, purify your hearts.
Be afflicted, and mourn and weep. Your laughter becomes a cry, and your joy a sadness!
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
Brothers, do not slander one another. He who murmurs of the brother, and judges his brother, murmurs of the law, and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
Only one is the giver of the law, who can save and destroy. Who are you to judge another?
Let's go now !, those of you who say: Today or tomorrow we will go to such a city, we will be there for a year, we will buy merchandise and we will win;
And you don't even know what tomorrow will be. Because what is your life? It is certainly a vapor that appears for a little while and then fades away.
Instead of which you should say: If the Lord wants, we will live and do this or that.
But now you boast in your pride. All such boasting is bad.
Sin, then, is in the one who knows how to do good and does not do it.
