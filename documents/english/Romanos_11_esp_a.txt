I say then: Has God rejected his people? No way! For I am also an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
God has not rejected his people, whom he previously knew. Or do you not know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel:
Lord, THEY HAVE GIVEN DEATH TO YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE DROPPED YOUR ALTARS; AND I HAVE JUST STAYED AND ATTEMPT AGAINST MY LIFE?
But what does the divine answer tell you ?: I HAVE SAVED SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BENT THE KNEE TO BAAL.
And in the same way, a remnant according to the election of God's grace has also remained in the present time.
But if it is by grace, it is no longer based on works, otherwise grace is no longer grace. And if by works, it is no longer grace; otherwise the work is no longer work.
So what? What Israel seeks has not reached it, but those who were chosen reached it and the others were hardened;
as it is written: GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES WITH WHICH THEY DO NOT SEE AND EARS WITH WHICH THEY DO NOT HEAR, UNTIL TODAY.
And David says: THEIR BANQUET BECOMES A TIE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING STONE AND A REMUNERATION FOR THEM.
DARK YOUR EYES SO THAT THEY CANNOT SEE, AND DOUBLE YOUR BACKES FOREVER.
I say then: Did they stumble to fall? No way! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to cause jealousy.
And if their transgression is wealth to the world, and their failure is wealth to the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness be!
But to you I speak, Gentiles. So since I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I honor my ministry,
if in any way I can make my compatriots jealous and save some of them.
Because if excluding them is the reconciliation of the world, what will be their admission, if not life from the dead?
And if the first piece of dough is holy, so is the whole dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted between them and made partakers with them of the rich sap of the olive root,
do not be arrogant towards the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that you are not the one who supports the root, but the root is the one that supports you.
Then you will say: The branches were cut off so that I could be grafted.
Very true; they were torn apart by their unbelief, but you by faith stand firm. Do not be haughty, but fear;
because if God did not forgive the natural branches, He will not forgive you either.
Look, then, at the goodness and severity of God; severity for those who fell, but for you, goodness of God if you remain in his goodness; otherwise you too will be cut off.
And they too, if they do not remain in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is mighty to graft them in again.
Because if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and against what is natural you were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more these, which are the natural branches, will be grafted into your own olive tree?
For I do not want you, brothers, to ignore this mystery, so that you are not wise in your own opinion: that Israel has undergone a partial hardening until the fullness of the Gentiles has entered;
and thus, all Israel will be saved; as it is written: THE LIBERATOR WILL COME FROM SIÃ“N; IT WILL REMOVE THE PROPERTY OF JACOB.
AND THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I REMOVE THEIR SINS.
As for the gospel, they are enemies because of you; but as for the election of God, they are loved because of the parents;
because the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
For just as you were once disobedient to God, but now you have been shown mercy by reason of their disobedience,
so now also these have been disobedient, so that by the mercy shown to you, also to them now may mercy be shown.
Because God has locked everyone in disobedience to show mercy to everyone.
O depth of riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
Well, WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD ?, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR ?,
OR WHO HAS GIVEN HIM FIRST SO THAT HE MUST BE REWARDED?
Because from Him, through Him and for Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
