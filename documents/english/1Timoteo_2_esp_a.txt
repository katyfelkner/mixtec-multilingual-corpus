I therefore exhort, above all, that requests, prayers, requests and thanksgivings be made for all men;
for the kings and for all those in authority, so that we can live a quiet and peaceful life with all piety and dignity.
Because this is good and pleasant before God our Savior,
who wants all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.
Because there is only one God, and also only one mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus the man,
who gave himself a ransom for all, testimony given in due course.
And for this I was made a preacher and an apostle (I tell the truth in Christ, I don't lie) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
Therefore, I want men everywhere to pray by lifting up holy hands, without anger or argument.
Likewise, that women dress in decent clothing, with modesty and modesty, not with ostentatious hairstyle, not with gold, or pearls, or expensive dresses;
but with good works, as befits the women who profess godliness.
Let the woman learn quietly, with all obedience.
I do not allow women to teach or exercise authority over men, but to remain silent.
Because Adam was created first, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being completely deceived, fell into transgression.
But you will be saved by begetting children, if you remain in faith, love and holiness, with modesty.
