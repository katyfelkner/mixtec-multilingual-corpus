But the Spirit clearly says that in recent times some will apostatize from the faith, paying attention to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,
through the hypocrisy of liars who have seared conscience;
forbidding to marry and ordering to abstain from foods that God has created so that with thanksgiving those who believe and who have known the truth participate in them.
Because everything created by God is good and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving;
because it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
By pointing these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nurtured with the words of faith and good doctrine that you have followed.
But you have nothing to do with the profane fables of old women. Rather discipline yourself for piety;
because physical exercise takes little advantage, but piety is profitable for everything, because it has promise for the present life and also for the future.
This is a faithful word, and worthy of being accepted by all.
Because for this we work and strive, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.
This commands and teaches.
Don't let anyone belittle your youth; Before, be an example to believers in word, conduct, love, faith, and purity.
As I arrive, engage in scripture reading, exhortation, and teaching.
Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was conferred on you through prophecy with the laying on of hands of the presbytery.
Reflect on these things; dedicate yourself to them, so that your use is evident to all.
Take care of yourself and teaching; persevere in these things, for in doing so you will secure salvation both for yourself and for those who listen to you.
