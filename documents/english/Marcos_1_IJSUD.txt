Principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, Son of God.
As it is written in Isaiah, the prophet: Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.
Voice of the one crying in the desert: Prepare the way of the Lord; straighten their paths.
John baptized in the desert and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
And all the province of Judea and those of Jerusalem went out to him; and they were all baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.
And John was dressed in camel's hair and with a leather belt around his back; and ate locusts and wild honey.
And he preached, saying: He comes after me who is more powerful than I, whom I am not worthy to untie, hunched over, the strap of his sandals.
I have indeed baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John at the Jordan.
And immediately, rising from the water, he saw the heavens open and the Spirit like a dove descending on him.
And a voice came from heaven saying: You are my Beloved Son; I am pleased with you.
And immediately the Spirit urged him to go into the desert.
And he was there in the desert forty days and was tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels served him.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
and saying: The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe the gospel.
And passing by the Sea of ​​Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting the net into the sea, because they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
And instantly, leaving their nets, they followed him.
And passing from there a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John; and they were also in the boat, mending the nets.
And immediately he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the day laborers, they went after him.
And they entered Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath, entering the synagogue, he taught.
And they admired his doctrine, because he taught them as someone who has authority and not as scribes.
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, who cried out,
saying: Ah, what have you got with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God.
And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be quiet and come out of him!
And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.
And they all marveled, in such a way that they argued among themselves, saying: What is this? What new doctrine is this, that with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him?
And his fame quickly spread throughout the province around Galilee.
And when they left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law was lying down with a fever; and they immediately told him about her.
Then, approaching him, he took her by the hand and raised her; and instantly the fever left her, and she served them.
And when evening fell, after the sun had gone down, they brought him all who were sick and possessed by demons;
and the whole city gathered at the door.
And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons; and he would not let the demons speak, because they knew him.
And rising early in the morning, while it was still very dark, he went out and went to a deserted place, and there he prayed.
And Simon and those who were with him sought him;
And when they found him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you.
And he said to them: Let us go to the neighboring places, so that I may also preach there, because for this I have come.
And he preached in their synagogues throughout Galilee, and cast out demons.
And a leper came to him, pleading with him; and kneeling down, he said: If you want, you can clean me.
And Jesus, having mercy on him, stretched out his hand, touched him and said: I want to; Be clean.
And as soon as he had spoken, the leprosy immediately left him, and he was clean.
So he strictly warned him, and fired him right away
And he said to him: Look, tell no one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your purification what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.
But he went out and began to publish it a lot and to spread the fact, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but stayed outside in the deserted places; and they came to him from everywhere.
