My brothers, may your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ be without respect for persons.
Because if a man with a gold ring and luxurious clothes enters your congregation, and also a poor man with a tattered dress enters,
and you care for the one who brings the luxurious garment, and you say to him: Sit here, in a good place, and you say to the poor: You stand there, or sit here under my platform,
Do you not make a distinction among yourselves and become judges with bad thoughts?
Hear it, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?
But you have dishonored the poor. Do not the rich oppress you, and are they not the same who drag you to court?
Do they not blaspheme the good name that was invoked upon you?
If in truth you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture: You will love your neighbor as yourself, you do well;
but if you accept people, you commit sin and you are found guilty by the law as transgressors.
Because anyone who keeps all the law, but offends at one point, becomes guilty of all.
For he who said, You shall not commit adultery, has also said, You shall not kill. Now, if you do not commit adultery, but kill, you have already become a transgressor of the law.
Thus speak, and thus do, as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
For judgment without mercy will be done with him who shows no mercy; and mercy triumphs over judgment.
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says that he has faith and has no works? Can faith save you?
And if a brother or sister is naked, and they need daily sustenance,
And one of you says to them: Go in peace, take shelter and be satisfied, but you do not give them the things that are necessary for the body: what will it benefit?
So also faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.
But someone will say: You have faith, and I have works; Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe and tremble.
But do you want to know, vain man, that faith without works is dead?
Was not our father Abraham justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
Do you not see that faith acted together with his works, and that faith was perfected by works?
And the Scripture was fulfilled that says: Abraham believed God, and it was counted for righteousness, and he was called a friend of God.
You see, then, that man is justified by works, and not only by faith.
Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she received the messengers, and sent them by another way?
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.
