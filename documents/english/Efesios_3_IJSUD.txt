For this reason I, Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles,
if you have heard of the commission of God's grace that has been given to you,
that by revelation the mystery was declared to me, as I have briefly written before.
By reading this, you can understand my understanding of the mystery of Christ,
which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to their holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
that the Gentiles are joint heirs, and members of the same body, and partners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
of whom I was made minister by the gift of the grace of God that has been given to me according to the action of his power.
To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, was given this grace to proclaim to the Gentiles the gospel of the inscrutable riches of Christ,
and to clarify to all what is the dispensation of the mystery hidden for centuries in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ.
That the manifold wisdom of God may now be made known through the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places,
according to the eternal purpose, which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have security and access with confidence through faith in him.
Therefore, I ask you not to lose heart because of my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
For this cause I bend my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name,
so that it may give you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power in the inner man by his Spirit,
so that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts, so that, rooted and grounded in love,
you are fully capable of understanding, with all the saints, what is the width, and the length, and the depth and the height,
and to know the love of Christ, which exceeds all knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
And to Him who is able to do all things much more abundantly than we ask or understand, according to the power that works in us,
to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus, for all ages, for ever and ever. Amen.
