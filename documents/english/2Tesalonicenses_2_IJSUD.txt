But we ask you, brothers, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our recollection with him,
that you do not easily change your way of thinking, nor are you troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word nor by letter as if it were ours, in the sense that the day of the Lord is near.
Let no one deceive you in any way, because he will not come without the apostasy coming first, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, manifesting himself,
opposing and rising against all that is called God, or that which is worshiped; as much as he sits in the temple of God as God, posing as God.
Don't you remember that when I was still with you, I was saying this to you?
And now you know what prevents it from being manifested in due course.
Because the mystery of iniquity is already at work; he only waits until the one who is preventing him now is removed;
and then that wicked one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the spirit of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming;
to that wicked one, whose advent is according to the work of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
and with all deceit of iniquity for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth to be saved.
Therefore, God sends you a powerful deception, so that you believe in the lie,
so that all may be condemned who did not believe in the truth, but took pleasure in iniquity.
But we must always thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, that God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation, through sanctification by the Spirit and by faith in the truth;
for which he called you through our gospel, to achieve the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
So, brethren, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings you have learned, be it by word, or by our letter.
May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
comfort your hearts, and confirm you in every good word and deed.
