My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin; but if anyone has sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just;
and he is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world.
And in this we know that we have known him: if we keep his commandments.
He who says: I have known him, but he does not keep his commandments, he is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
but whoever keeps his word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected; by this we know that we are in it.
He who says he abides in him must walk as he walked.
Brothers, I am not writing you a new commandment, but the old commandment that you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word that you have heard from the beginning.
On the other hand, I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.
He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no stumbling in him.
But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you by name.
I am writing to you, parents, because you have known who he is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I am writing to you, children, because you have known the Father.
I have written to you, parents, because you have known the one who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
Do not love the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not in him.
Because everything in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, does not come from the Father, but from the world.
And the world passes, and its lust; but he who does the will of God remains forever.
Little children, it is the last time; and as you have heard that the antichrist was to come, so now many antichrists have arisen; by this we know that it is the last time.
They came out of us, but they were not of us; because if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out to show that not all of them belong to us.
But you have the anointing of the Saint and you know all things.
I have written to you, not because you ignore the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie comes from the truth.
Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son.
Anyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either. Everyone who confesses the Son also has the Father.
Therefore what you have heard from the beginning abides in you. If what you have heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.
And this is the promise that he made to us: eternal life.
I have written this to you about those who deceive you.
But the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; just as the anointing itself teaches you about all things, and it is true, and it is not a lie, just as it has taught you, abide in it.
And now, little children, remain in him so that when he appears, we will have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
If you know that he is just, know also that everyone who does justice is born of him.
