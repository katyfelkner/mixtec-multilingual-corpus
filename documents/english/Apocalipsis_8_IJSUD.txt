And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for almost half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels that were before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.
And another angel came, and stood before the altar, with a golden censer; and much incense was given to him to add to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
And the smoke of the incense rose from the angel's hand before God, with the prayers of the saints.
And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire from the altar and threw it to the ground; and there was thunder, and voices, and lightning, and an earthquake.
And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
And the first angel blew the trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown down to the earth; and a third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was burned.
And the second angel blew the trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea turned to blood.
And a third of the living creatures that were in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on the third part of the rivers and on the sources of the waters.
And the name of the star is Wormwood. And a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they had become bitter.
And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and a third of the sun, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were smitten, so that a third of them were darkened, and there was no light in the third part of the day or the third part of the night.
And I looked, and I heard an angel fly through the middle of the sky, saying with a loud voice: Oh! Oh! Woe to those who dwell on earth, because of the other trumpet blasts that the three angels are yet to play!
