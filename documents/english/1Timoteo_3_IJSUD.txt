Faithful Word: If anyone wants the office of bishop, he wants a good deed.
Therefore, the bishop should be blameless, the husband of one woman, sober, prudent, decent, hospitable, able to teach;
not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy for dishonest earnings, but moderate, non-contentious, oblivious to greed;
that he governs his house well, that he has his children in subjection with all honesty
(Because the one who does not know how to burden his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?);
not a neophyte, lest he be puffed up and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
It is also necessary that you have a good testimony on the part of strangers, so that you do not fall in affront and in the devil's bond.
Deacons, likewise, must be honest, one-word, not given to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain,
that they retain the mystery of faith with a clear conscience.
And these are also previously tested; and then minister as deacons, if you are blameless.
Women, too, be honest, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in everything.
Deacons are the husbands of one wife, and they govern their children and their houses well.
For those who have ministered well as deacons gain for themselves an honorable degree, and much confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
This I am writing to you in the hope of coming soon to you;
so that if I don't go soon, you know how you should behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, column and support of the truth.
And indisputably, great is the mystery of divinity: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by the angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed in the world and received above in glory.
