What is goiter.
Goiter, commonly called "buche o güegüencho" is a disease characterized essentially by the presence of a bulge in the front of the neck
The cause of the goiter.
The human system needs iodine,
and when it is not found in the water or soil in the area, food is deficient in this element.
Goiter is almost always due to a lack of iodine in food and drinking water
Consequences of goiter.
Goiter produces very serious disorders of the nervous system, the heart, and nutrition, disorders that force those who suffer it to undergo delicate surgical operations to heal themselves.
In some other cases, goiter can develop into a malignant tumor, that is, a cancer, which, as is known, is always a serious disease that often leads to death.
There are cases in which the same disturbances become so great that the patient is unable to learn to speak and cannot even serve himself in the simple tasks of life.
It is also very common for goiters to be deaf mute, while others suffer such a considerable delay in their development that they become dwarfs.
