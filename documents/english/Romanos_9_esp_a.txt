I tell the truth in Christ, I don't lie, my conscience bearing witness to me in the Holy Spirit,
that I have great sadness and continuous pain in my heart.
Because I would like to be anathema myself, separated from Christ for love of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh,
that they are Israelites, to whom the adoption as children belongs, and the glory, the covenants, the promulgation of the law, the worship and the promises,
from whom are the patriarchs, and from whom, according to the flesh, comes the Christ, who is above all things, God blessed forever. Amen.
But it is not that the word of God has failed. Because not all the descendants of Israel are Israel;
nor are they all children because they are descendants of Abraham, but BY ISAAC YOUR DESCENT WILL BE CALLED.
That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are considered as descendants.
Because this is a word of promise: FOR THIS TIME I WILL COME BACK, AND SARA WILL HAVE A SON.
And not only this, but also Rebecca, when she conceived twins of one, our father Isaac
(because when the twins had not yet been born, and had done nothing, neither good nor bad, so that God's purpose according to his election would remain, not by works, but by the one who calls),
it was said to her: THE GREATEST WILL SERVE THE LESS.
As it is written: I LOVED JACOB, BUT I HATED ESAU.
What shall we say then? That there is injustice in God? No way!
Because He says to Moses: I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.
So it does not depend on the one who wants or on the one who runs, but on God who has mercy.
Because the Scripture says to Pharaoh: FOR THIS SAME I HAVE RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND SO THAT MY NAME IS PROCLAIMED BY ALL THE EARTH.
So he has mercy on the one he wants, and the one he loves hardens.
Then you will say to me: Why, then, does God still reproach? Because who resists his will?
On the contrary, who are you, oh man, who answers God? Does the modeled object say to the model: Why did you do this to me?
Or does the potter not have the right over the clay to make from the same mass one vase for honorable use and another for ordinary use?
And what if God, while willing to show his anger and make his power known, patiently endured the vessels of anger prepared for destruction?
He did it to make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
that is, we, whom he also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles.
As it also says in Hosea: TO THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, I WILL CALL: "MY PEOPLE", AND THE ONE WHO WAS NOT LOVED: "MY BELOVED".
AND IT WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM: "YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE", THERE THEY WILL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.
Isaiah also exclaims regarding Israel: EVEN IF THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IS LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, ONLY THE REMNANT WILL BE SAVED;
FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH CABALLY AND WITH BRIEFNESS.
And as Isaiah predicted: IF THE LORD OF THE ARMIES HAD NOT LEFT US DESCENT, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOMA, AND FACTS LIKE GOMORRA.
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who were not after justice, achieved justice, that is, justice that is by faith;
but Israel, which was after a law of justice, did not achieve that law.
Why? Because they did not go after her by faith, but as by works. They stumbled on the stumbling block,
As it is written, Behold, I lay a stumbling stone and a rock of scandal in Zion: and he that believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
