The old man to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only me, but also all who have known the truth,
because of the truth that remains in us and that will be with us forever:
May the grace, mercy and peace of God the Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Father, be with you in truth and love.
I have rejoiced greatly because I have found some of your children who walk in the truth, just as we have received the commandment of the Father.
And now I beg you, madam, not as writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment: Walk in love, as you have heard from the beginning.
Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
See for yourselves, lest we lose the things we have accomplished, but receive the full reward.
Everyone who deviates and does not persevere in the doctrine of Christ does not have God; he who perseveres in the doctrine of Christ, he does have the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him at home or say: Welcome!
Because the one who says welcome is participating in his evil deeds.
Although I have many things to write to you, I did not want to communicate them through paper and ink, since I hope to go to you and speak face to face, so that our joy is complete.
The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
