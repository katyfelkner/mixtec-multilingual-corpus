In the case, members of the indigenous community of San Jacinto Yaveloxi, belonging to the municipality of Santiago Choápam, Oaxaca, promoted a trial for the protection of the political-electoral rights of the citizen against the agreement via jump of the instance (per saltum) issued by the General Council of the State Electoral and Citizen Participation Institute of Oaxaca, alleging the incorrect validity of an assembly act in which the municipal authorities were chosen within the framework of the customs and practices of the indigenous community to which that belong. The contested act could have been known and resolved by the state electoral court, but due to the alleged irregularities manifested by the prosecutors, which were found to be closely related to the resolution, it was considered that due to the importance and importance of the matter, and in order to avoid that the issuance of contradictory judgments between the state electoral court and the Superior Chamber could occur, the per saltum was updated, that is, that the Superior Chamber heard of the challenge.
