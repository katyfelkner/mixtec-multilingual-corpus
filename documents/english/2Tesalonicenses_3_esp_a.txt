Finally, brothers, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord will spread quickly and be glorified, as it also happened with you;
and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, because not everyone has faith.
But faithful is the Lord who will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you do and will do what we command.
May the Lord direct your hearts towards the love of God and towards the perseverance of Christ.
Now, brothers, we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to separate yourself from every brother who walks disorderly, and not according to the doctrine you received from us.
Well, you yourselves know how you should follow our example, because we do not act undisciplined among you,
nor did we eat anyone's bread in vain, but with labor and fatigue we labor day and night so as not to be a burden to any of you;
not because we have no right to it, but to offer ourselves as a model for you to follow our example.
Because even when we were with you we ordered this: If someone does not want to work, they should not eat either.
Because we hear that some of you are disorderly, without working, but they are getting into everything.
We command and exhort such people in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work quietly to eat their own bread.
But you, brothers, do not tire of doing good.
And if anyone does not obey our teaching in this letter, point to such and do not associate with him, to be ashamed.
However, do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
And may the Lord of peace himself always grant you peace in all circumstances. The Lord be with you all.
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinctive sign in all my letters; that's how I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
