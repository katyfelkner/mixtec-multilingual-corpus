With regard to the sacrifices to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
If someone imagines they know something, they still don't know anything as they should.
But if someone loves God, such a person is known to him.
So, about the food of sacrifices to idols, we know that the idol is nothing in the world and that there is only one God.
Because although it is true that some are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
However, for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all things proceed, and we live for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things exist, and we also live through him.
However, not everyone has this knowledge; because some, until now, accustomed to the idol, eat the food as something sacrificed to the idols, and their conscience is contaminated by being weak.
But it is not food that recommends us to God; because we are not less if we do not eat, nor are we more if we eat.
But see that this your freedom is not a stumbling block for the weak.
For if someone sees you who have knowledge, sitting at the table in the place of idols, is it not true that the conscience of the weak will be encouraged to eat of what is sacrificed to idols?
Thus, through your knowledge, the weak will be lost, a brother for whom Christ died.
In this way, sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak consciences, they are sinning against Christ.
Therefore, if food is an occasion for my brother to fall, I will never eat meat, so as not to stumble my brother.
