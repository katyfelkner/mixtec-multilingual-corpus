Therefore, unable to bear it any longer, we agreed to stay alone in Athens,
and we send Timothy, our brother, minister of God and our collaborator in the gospel of Christ, to confirm and exhort you in your faith,
so that nobody worries about these tribulations, because you yourselves know that we have been set for this.
Because even when we were with you, we predicted that we would go through tribulations, as has happened and you well know.
Therefore I too, being unable to bear any more, have sent to inform myself of your faith, lest the tempter tempted you, and our work was in vain.
But when Timothy returned from you to us, he gave us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have fond memories of us, wishing to see us, as we also do to you.
For this reason, brothers, we receive comfort from you, in the midst of our need and affliction, because of your faith;
because now we live, if you are firm in the Lord.
Therefore, what thanksgiving can we give to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,
praying night and day with great fervor, that we may see your face, and that we may complete what is lacking in your faith?
But the same God and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our journey to you.
And the Lord multiply you and make you abound in love for each other, and for everyone, just as it is ours for you;
so that your hearts may be confirmed, blameless in holiness before God our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
