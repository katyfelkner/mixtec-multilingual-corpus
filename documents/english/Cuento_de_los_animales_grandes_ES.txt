Story of the big animals
Children have a habit.
They get together when there is a moon and begin to tell stories.
The stories they like the most are the rabbit, because those are the ones told by their parents, the elderly.
Children tell all the stories they know.
This story goes like this:
In a large plain all the large animals gathered: the lion, the tiger, the fox, the turtle - all the large animals
and they said they were going to call the rabbit to tell them where the sun was rising.
But the rabbit did not want to go.
They sent him a waiter but the rabbit did not want to go.
Then they sent him another waiter.
Again the rabbit did not want to go, because the lion and the tiger are the most important and have waiters.
Finally they sent the turtle, which said to the rabbit:
-Uncle rabbit, uncle rabbit!
-What do you want turtle nephew?
Said the rabbit.
-The president says to come for a while.
-What do you want with me?
I'm not going because I don't know why he wants me.
The turtle thought and thought and then said to the rabbit:
-Uncle rabbit, my stomach hurts a lot; push a little here on my stomach with your hand.
The rabbit put his hand up to the turtle's stomach, and stuck it in a lot. It didn't come out anymore.
Then the turtle took him away, pulling him to where the authorities were. Then the rabbit told them where the sun was rising.
He said that the sun came from the mountains and went into the sea.
He also said that the moon came from the west and went where the sun rose.
That was what the rabbit said.
This is how the rabbit started that habit, and until now people can see that it is so.
