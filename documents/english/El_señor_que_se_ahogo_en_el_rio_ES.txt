The lord who drowned in the river
A man was wearing a lot of jewelry.
When he was walking on the road he found a river, and he had to cross it. There was no bridge or boat to cross that river.
Then he took off his huaraches and started crossing it. Since the stones he was carrying were very heavy, he could not pass the river because the current was very strong. Then he tried harder, and kept going and came in the middle.
Then another man who stood on the shore said to him:
- Leave the things you carry because they are too heavy and you are in danger of falling in the water, and you will drown.
But he did not want to leave them. Then, as he weighed heavily, he fell into the water, and went to the bottom. There he drowned, and died. Not only her jewelry was destroyed, but also her life.
