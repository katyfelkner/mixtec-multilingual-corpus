Chapter II - ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS
ARTICLE 10. The State shall guarantee the right of indigenous peoples and communities to access the jurisdiction of the State in the national indigenous language of which they are speakers. To guarantee this right, in all trials and procedures to which they are party, individually or collectively, their customs and cultural specificities must be taken into account, respecting the precepts of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States.
The federal authorities responsible for the procurement and administration of justice, including the agrarian and labor authorities, will provide what is necessary so that in the trials they carry out, the indigenous people are assisted free of charge, at all times, by interpreters and defenders who are aware of their indigenous language and culture.
In the terms of article 5, in the states and municipalities with communities that speak indigenous languages, the measures referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be adopted and implemented, in the instances that are required.
