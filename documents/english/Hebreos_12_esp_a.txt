Therefore, since we have around us our great cloud of witnesses, let us also divest ourselves of all weight and the sin that so easily envelops us, and let us run with patience the race that lies ahead,
set our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of the faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising shame, and sat at the right hand of the throne of God.
Consider, then, the one who endured such hostility from sinners against himself, so that you do not tire or become discouraged in your heart.
Because still, in your fight against sin, you have not resisted to the point of shedding blood;
Furthermore, you have forgotten the exhortation that is addressed to you as children: My son, do not disregard the Lord's discipline, nor be discouraged when being rebuked by Him;
For the Lord who loves, disciplines, and scourges everyone who receives him as a son.
It is for your correction that you suffer; God treats you like children; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made participants, then you are illegitimate children and not true children.
Furthermore, we had earthly parents to discipline us, and we respected them, how much more reason will we not be subject to the Father of our spirits, and live?
Because they disciplined us for a few days as it seemed, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we share in his holiness.
At present no discipline seems to be a cause of joy, but of sadness; however, to those who have been exercised through it, it afterwards yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
Therefore strengthen your weak hands and weak knees,
and make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame leg does not get out of joint, but heals.
Seek peace with all and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.
Take care that no one fails to attain the grace of God; that no root of bitterness, sprouting, causes difficulties and by it many are contaminated;
that there is no immoral or profane person like Esau who sold his birthright for a meal.
Because you know that even later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he found no occasion for repentance, although he sought it with tears.
For you have not come near a touchable mountain, nor burning fire, nor darkness, nor darkness, nor whirlwind,
neither at the sound of a trumpet, nor at the noise of words, such that those who heard prayed that they should not be spoken to any more;
because they could not bear the command: If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
So terrible was the spectacle, that Moses said: I am terrified and trembling.
You, however, have approached Mount Zion and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels,
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are inscribed in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous already made perfect,
and Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, and the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood.
See that you do not reject the speaker. Because if those did not escape when they rejected the one who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we turn away from the one who warns us from heaven.
His voice then shook the earth, but now He has promised, saying: Yet again, I will shake not only the earth, but also the sky.
And this expression: Yet, once again, indicates the removal of moving things, such as created things, so that things that are unshakable remain.
Therefore, since we receive a kingdom that is unshakable, let us show gratitude, by which we offer God an acceptable service with fear and reverence;
because our God is a consuming fire.
