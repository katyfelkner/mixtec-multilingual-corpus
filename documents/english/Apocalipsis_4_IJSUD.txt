After this I looked, and behold, an open door in heaven; And the first voice that I heard was like a trumpet speaking to me, saying: Come up here, and I will show you the things that will happen after these.
And immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on it.
And the one who sat was similar in appearance to a jasper and carnelian stone; and around the throne was a rainbow similar in appearance to the emerald.
And around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and I saw on the thrones twenty-four seated old men, dressed in white robes, and had on their heads golden crowns.
And lightning came from the throne, and thunder and voices; and seven lamps of fire burned before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
And before the throne was like a sea of ​​glass like glass; and in the middle of the throne, and around the throne, four living beings full of eyes in front and behind.
And the first living being was like a lion; and the second living being was like a calf; and the third living being had a man's face; and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle.
And the four living beings each had six wings around them, and inside they were full of eyes; and they had no rest day or night, saying: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
And every time those living beings give glory and honor and praise to the one who sits on the throne, to the one who lives forever and ever,
the twenty-four elders bow down before him who sits on the throne, and worship the one who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
Lord, you are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because you created all things, and by your will they exist and were created.
