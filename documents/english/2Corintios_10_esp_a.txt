And I myself, Paul, I beg you for the meekness and kindness of Christ, I who am humble when I am before you, but daring towards you when I am absent,
I pray, therefore, that when I am present, I do not have to be daring with the confidence with which I intend to proceed resolutely against some who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.
For although we walk in the flesh, we do not fight according to the flesh;
for the weapons of our strife are not carnal, but powerful in God for the destruction of fortresses;
destroying speculation and all haughty reasoning that rises up against the knowledge of God, and putting every thought in captivity to the obedience of Christ,
and being prepared to punish all disobedience when your obedience is complete.
You see things according to the outward appearance. If anyone has self-confidence that he is Christ's, consider this within himself again: that just as he is Christ's, so are we.
For though I glory even more in our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I will not be ashamed,
so it doesn't seem like I want to scare you with my letters.
Because they say: The letters are severe and harsh, but the physical presence is not very impressive, and the way of speaking is negligible.
Let this person take into account: that what we are in word by letter, being absent, we are also in deed, being present.
Because we dare not count or compare ourselves with some who praise themselves; but they, measuring themselves and comparing themselves, lack understanding.
But we will not glory excessively, but within the measure of the sphere that God indicated as the limit to also reach you.
For we do not exceed ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we were the first to reach you with the gospel of Christ;
not glorifying ourselves excessively, that is, in the works of others, but hoping that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, further enhanced by you,
to proclaim the gospel even to the regions beyond you, and not to glory in what has already been done in the sphere of another.
But he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.
For he who praises himself is not approved, but he whom the Lord praises.
