And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels who had seven plagues, the last ones, because in them the fury of God has been consummated.
I also saw like a sea of ​​glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast, over its image and over the number of its name, standing on the sea of ​​glass, with harps of God.
And they sang * the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are your works, O Lord God, Almighty! Righteous and true are your ways, O King of the nations!
Oh Lord! Who will not fear and glorify your name? Well, only you are holy; for all nations will come and worship in your presence, for your righteous judgments have been revealed.
After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of witness in heaven was opened,
And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure and shining linen, and girded around the chest with golden bands.
Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden cups filled with the fury of God, who lives forever and ever.
And the temple was filled with the smoke of the glory of God and of his power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
