Now, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our meeting with him, we ask you, brothers,
that they are not easily moved from their way of thinking or alarmed by spirit or by word or letter as if it were ours, as if the day of the Lord had already arrived.
No one deceives you in any way; for this will not happen without the falling away first and the man of iniquity [a], the son of perdition, manifesting himself.
He will oppose and rise up against all that is called God or that is worshiped, so much so that he will sit in the temple of God posing as God [b].
Don't you remember that while I was still with you I was saying this to you?
Now they know what is holding him back, so that in due course he will be revealed.
Because the mystery of iniquity is already at work; he only waits until the one who stops him now is removed.
And then that wicked one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming [c].
The advent of the wicked is by the operation of Satan, with all false power, signs, and wonders,
and with all deceit of injustice among those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth to be saved.
Therefore, God will send you a force of deception to believe the lie,
so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but took pleasure in injustice.
But we must always thank God for you, dear brothers of the Lord, that God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation, for the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in the truth.
To this end God called them through our gospel to achieve the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
So, brothers, be firm and retain the doctrines in which they have been taught, either by word or by our letter.
And the same Lord our Jesus Christ, and our Father God who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,
animate your heart and confirm you in every good deed and word.
