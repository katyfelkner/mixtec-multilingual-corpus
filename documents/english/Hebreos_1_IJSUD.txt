God, having spoken many times and in many ways in another time to the parents through the prophets,
in these last days he has spoken to us through the Son, whom he established as heir to everything, and by whom, likewise, he made the universe,
who, being the radiance of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and who sustains all things with the word of his power, having accomplished the purification of our sins by himself, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
made so much superior to the angels as he inherited a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the angels did God ever say: You are my son, I have begotten you today, and again: I will be his Father, and he will be my son?
And again, when he introduces the Firstborn into the world, he says: And worship all the angels of God.
And certainly, of the angels he says: He who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
But of the son he says: Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever; scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom;
You have loved justice and hated evil, for which God, your God, anointed you with oil of joy more than your companions.
And: You, O Lord, in the beginning founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
They will perish, but you remain; and all of them will grow old like a garment;
and like a garment you will wrap them, and they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will not end.
Well, to which of the angels did he ever say: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to serve on behalf of those who will inherit salvation?
