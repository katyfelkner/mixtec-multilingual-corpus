But in myself I decided this: not to come to you again with sadness.
Because if I cause you sadness, who will be the one who makes me happy but the one I saddened?
And this is what I wrote to you, so that when I arrive I will not have sadness on the part of those who should rejoice, trusting all of you that my joy is the same for all of you.
Because of the great affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to sadden you, but to let you know the love that I have especially for you.
But if anyone has caused sadness, it has not caused me, but to a certain extent (not to exaggerate) all of you.
This punishment that was imposed by the majority is sufficient for such a person;
so, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest in some way he be overwhelmed by so much sadness.
Therefore I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
Well, also for this purpose I wrote to you, to test you and see if you are obedient in everything.
But whoever forgives something, I also forgive; because in truth, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did for you in the presence of Christ,
so that Satan does not take advantage of us, because we do not ignore his schemes.
When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
I had no rest in my spirit when I did not find Titus, my brother; Saying goodbye to them, I went to Macedonia.
But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and who through us manifests everywhere the fragrance of his knowledge.
For we are to God the fragrant aroma of Christ among those who are saved and among those who perish;
for some, the smell of death for death, and for others, the smell of life for life. And for these things, who is qualified?
For we are not like many, who trade the word of God, but sincerely, as from God and before God we speak in Christ.
