When it was decided that we should embark for Italy, Pablo and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion of the Augusta company, named Julio.
And embarking on an Adramite ship that was about to set sail for the coastal regions of Asia, we went to sea accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
The next day we arrived in Sidon. Julio treated Pablo with benevolence, allowing him to go to his friends and be cared for by them.
From there we started and sailed under the protection of the island of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
And after sailing across the sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Mira de Licia.
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship that was going to Italy, and embarked us on it.
And after sailing slowly for many days, and arriving with difficulty in front of Gnido, since the wind did not allow us to advance any further, we sailed in the shelter of Crete, in front of Salmón;
and coping with difficulty, we arrived at a place called Buenos Puertos, near which was the city of Lasea.
When a long time had passed and navigation had become dangerous, since even the Fast had already passed, Paul admonished them,
saying to them: Friends, I see that this trip will surely be with prejudice and serious losses, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.
But the centurion was more persuaded by what was said by the pilot and the captain of the ship, than by what Pablo said.
And since the port was not suitable for wintering, most decided to go to sea from there, in case it was possible to arrive at Fenice, a port of Crete that faces northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there .
When a moderate south wind began to blow, believing they had accomplished their purpose, they set anchor and sailed off shore to Crete.
But not long after, a hurricane wind called Euroclidón began to blow from the ground,
and the ship being whipped, and not being able to face the wind, we abandoned ourselves to it and let ourselves drift.
Sailing in the shelter of a small island called Clauda, ​​with great difficulty we were able to hold the skiff.
After they lifted it up, they used mooring lines to secure the ship; and fearing to run aground on the banks of Sirte, they dropped the floating anchor and drifted away.
The next day, as we were furiously shaken by the storm, they began to drop the load;
and on the third day, with their own hands, they cast the ship's rigging into the sea.
As neither the sun nor the stars appeared for many days, and a no small storm fell upon us, since then we have abandoned all hope of saving ourselves.
When many days had passed without eating, Paul stood up among them and said: Friends, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete, thus avoiding this injury and loss.
But now I urge you to be of good cheer, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
Because tonight an angel of the God of whom I am and whom I serve was in my presence,
saying, "Do not be afraid, Paul; you must appear before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you."
Therefore, be of good cheer, my friends, because I trust God, that it will happen exactly as I was told.
But we have to run aground on a certain island.
And when the fourteenth night came, while we were drifting in the Adriatic Sea, at about midnight the sailors sensed that they were approaching land.
They put in the probe and found that there were twenty fathoms; passing a little further they took the probe again and found fifteen fathoms deep.
And fearing that somewhere we were going to hit the reefs, they threw four anchors by the stern and longed for the sunrise.
As the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had lowered the skiff into the sea, under the pretext that they intended to drop anchors from the bow,
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers: If they do not remain on the ship, you cannot be saved.
Then the soldiers cut the mooring lines of the skiff and allowed it to be lost.
And until it was nearly dawn, Paul exhorted everyone to take food, saying: It has been fourteen days now that, constantly watching, they have been fasting, without taking any food.
So I advise you to take food, because this is necessary for your survival; for not a single hair on the head of any of you shall perish.
Having said this, he took bread and thanked God in the presence of all; and breaking it, he began to eat.
Then everyone, having good spirits, also took food.
In total we were two hundred and seventy-six people on the ship.
Once satiated, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.
When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but could distinguish a bay that had a beach, and decided to launch the ship towards it, if possible.
And cutting the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the mooring lines of the rudders; and hoisting the bow sail into the wind, they headed toward the beach.
But colliding against a reef where two currents meet, they ran aground on the ship; the bow nailed and remained motionless, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves.
And the soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would escape by swimming;
but the centurion, wanting to save Paul, impeded his purpose, and ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and land,
and the others to follow, some on planks, and others on different objects on the ship. And so it happened that all arrived safely on land.
