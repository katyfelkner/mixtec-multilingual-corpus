God, having once spoken to parents many times and in many ways to the prophets,
in these last days he has spoken to us through the Son, whom he established as heir to everything and through whom, likewise, he made the universe.
He is the radiance of his glory and the exact expression of his nature, who sustains all things with the word of his power. And when he had cleansed us from our sins [a], he sat at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
He was made both superior to angels, just as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say: You are my son; I have begotten you today [b]; and again: I will be for him, Father; and he will be for me, Son [c]?
Again, as he introduces the Firstborn into the world, he says: Worship all the angels of God [d].
And of the angels he says: He makes his angels winds [e], and his servants a flame of fire [f];
while the Son says: Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever; scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.
You loved justice and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, anointed you with oil of joy, more than your companions [g].
And: You, O Lord, in the beginning founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
They will perish, but you remain; they will all grow old like a dress.
You will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed into clothing. But you are the same, and your years will not end [h].
And to which of his angels has he ever said: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool [i]?
Are they not all serving spirits sent to minister on behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?
