When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels standing before God, and they were given seven trumpets.
And another angel came and stood before the altar. He had a golden censer, and much incense was given to him to add to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
And the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints rose from the angel's hand in the presence of God.
And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the ground. And there was thunder and thunder and lightning and an earthquake.
The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
The first one played the trumpet. And there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown down to the ground. And a third of the earth was burned, and a third of the trees was burned, and all the green grass was burned.
The second angel blew the trumpet. And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. And a third of the sea became blood;
and a third of the living creatures that were in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
The third angel blew the trumpet. And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch; and fell on a third of the rivers and on the water sources.
The star's name is Wormwood. And a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
The fourth angel blew the trumpet. And a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were wounded, so that a third of them were darkened, and the day did not light for a third, and also the night of the same way.
I looked and heard an eagle [a] fly through the middle of the sky, saying with a loud voice: "Woe, woe, woe to those who live on earth, because of the other trumpet blasts that the three angels still have to play!".
