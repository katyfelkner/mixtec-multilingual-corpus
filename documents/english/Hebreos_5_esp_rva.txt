For every high priest who is taken from among men is constituted for service on behalf of men before God, to offer offerings and sacrifices for sins.
He can feel compassion for the ignorant and the lost, since he too is surrounded by weakness.
And because of this weakness he must offer sacrifice, both for his own sins and for those of the people.
And no one takes this honor for himself except because he has been called by God, as Aaron was.
So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest, but he glorified him who said to him: You are my son; I have begotten you today [a].
As it also says elsewhere: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek [b].
Christ, in the days of his physical life, having offered prayers and supplications with a loud cry and tears to the one who could deliver him from death, was heard for his reverent fear.
Although he was a Son, he learned obedience by what he suffered.
And having been perfected, he became the Author of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
and he was proclaimed by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
We have a lot to say about this, although it is difficult to explain, because you have become slow to hear.
Having already been teachers for the time elapsed, they again need someone to instruct them from the first rudiments of God's words. They have come to need milk and not solid food.
For everyone who feeds on milk is not able to understand the word of justice, because he is still a child.
But solid food is for the mature; for those who, by practice, have their senses trained to discern between good and evil.
