The little mouse that eats omelette
Once upon a time there was a lady who kept the leftover dried tortillas on the table every night;
but the little mouse ate the dry tortillas. When the new day dawned, the lady found these tortillas well mocha and said:
Poor little devil devil, you ate my tortillas! Okay, now you are going to see, little mouse; after a while at night I will keep them higher.
Then, when it was night, he kept them all the way up, but it turned out that the next day he found the tortillas well cooked. The lady said again:
Oh, little mouse! You ate my tortillas again, how can you not get sick?
Suddenly, the lady began to remove the edges of the tortillas where the little mouse had eaten; but the little mouse was sitting on top of a corner of the house, he saw that the lady was removing the edges of the omelette and very amazed he said: But the lady is really disgusted where I was eating!
How where did my little eggs go?
