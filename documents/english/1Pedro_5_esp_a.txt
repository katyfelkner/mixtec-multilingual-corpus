Therefore, to the elders among you, I exhort, an elder like them and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also partaker of the glory that is to be revealed:
Shepherd the flock of God among you, watching over him, not by obligation, but voluntarily, as God wants; not with the greed of money, but with sincere desire;
Neither as having dominion over those entrusted to you, but proving to be examples of the flock.
And when the Prince of the Shepherds appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the older ones; and all, clothe yourselves with humility in your mutual treatment, because GOD RESISTS THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time,
casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.
Thirst for evil spirit, be alert. Your adversary, the devil, stalks like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
But resist him firm in the faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being fulfilled in your brothers throughout the world.
And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, affirm, strengthen, and establish you.
To Him be dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
Through Silvano, our faithful brother (because I consider it so), I have written briefly to you, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Be firm in it.
The one in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you, and so does my son Mark.
Greet each other with a kiss of brotherly love.
