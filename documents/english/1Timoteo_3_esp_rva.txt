Faithful is this word: If someone longs for the bishopric, he wants a good work.
Then it is necessary that the bishop be of impeccable conduct, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, decent, hospitable, able to teach
not given to wine, not violent but kind, not contentious or money lover.
That he governs his house well and has his children in subjection with all dignity.
Because if someone does not know how to govern his own house, how will he take care of God's church?
That he is not a recent convert so that he does not fill himself with pride and fall into the damnation of the devil.
You must also have a good testimony from outsiders so that you do not fall into the reproach and trap of the devil.
Likewise, deacons must be worthy of respect, without a double tongue, not given to much wine, or lovers of dishonest gain.
that they keep the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
Let them be tried first and then serve as deacons, if they are found blameless.
Women must also be worthy of respect, not slanderers, sober, faithful in everything.
Deacons are husbands of a single wife who rule well over their children and their own homes.
Because those who serve well as deacons gain for themselves a good reputation and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
I am writing this to you, hoping to see you soon,
so that, if I delay, you will know how it is convenient for you to conduct yourself in the house [a] of God, which is the church of the living God, column and foundation of truth.
Unquestionably, great is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed in the world, and received above in glory.
