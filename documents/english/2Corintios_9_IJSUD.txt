Because as for the ministry of aid for the saints, it is not necessary for me to write to you;
for I know your good will, of which I glory among those of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stimulated many.
But I have sent the brothers, so that our boasting of you is not vain in this part; so that, as I have said, you are prepared;
lest, if some Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed, if not you, of this our trust.
Therefore, I considered it necessary to exhort the brothers to come first to you, and prepare first your generous offering before promised, so that it is ready as generosity, and not as our demand.
But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; And he who sows in abundance will also reap in abundance.
Each one should give as he proposed in his heart, not with sadness, nor out of necessity, because God loves the cheerful giver.
And powerful is God to make all grace abound in you; so that, always having enough in all things, you abound for every good work.
As it is written: He scattered, gave to the poor; his justice remains forever.
And he who gives seed to him who sows, will also give bread to eat, and will multiply your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
so that you are enriched in everything for all generosity, which produces through us thanksgiving to God.
Because the administration of this service not only supplies what the saints lack, but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God;
for by the experience of this ministry of aid they glorify God for the obedience that you profess to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution for them and for all;
likewise by their prayer for you, those who love you from the heart because of the superabundant grace of God in you.
Thank God for his unspeakable gift!
