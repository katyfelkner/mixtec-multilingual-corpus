This is the third time I have come to you. Any matter [a] will be decided by the mouth of two or three witnesses.
I have said it before, when I was present on my second trip and, now that I am absent, I also repeat it to those who have sinned before and to all the others: that if I go again, I will not be indulgent,
since they are looking for proof that Christ speaks in me. And he is not weak towards you, but he is powerful in you.
Because he was crucified in weakness, but he lives by the power of God. For we too are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God towards you.
Examine yourselves to see if you are firm in the faith; test yourselves. Or do you not know about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are already reproved?
But I hope you acknowledge that we are not failing.
And we pray to God that they don't do anything wrong; not so that we may appear approved, but so that you may do what is good, even if we remain as disapproved.
Because we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth.
So we rejoice that we are weak and that you are strong. And this we ask for: your maturity.
Therefore, I am writing this to you while you are away so that when you are present I do not use harshness according to the authority that the Lord has given me for edification and not for destruction.
As for the rest, brothers, rejoice. Be mature; be comforted; be of the same mind. Live in peace, and the God of peace and love will be with you.
Greet each other with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all [b].
