Paul, Silas and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians, in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace [a].
We always thank God for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers.
We constantly remember, before God and our Father, the work of his faith, the work of his love and the perseverance of his hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Because we have known, beloved brothers of God, his choice;
because our gospel did not come to you only in words, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit, and in full conviction. You know how we act among you on your behalf.
They also imitated us and the Lord, receiving the word in the midst of great tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Spirit;
in such a way that they have been an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
Because the word of the Lord has resounded from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia but also your faith in God has spread everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything.
Well, they themselves tell us about the good reception we had from you, and how you turned from idols to God to serve the living and true God.
and to await from heaven his Son, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
