Brothers, if anyone is caught in any fault, you who are spiritual, restore him with a spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
Because he who believes himself to be something, being nothing, deceives himself.
So, each one examine his own work, and then he will have reason to glory only with respect to himself, and not with respect to another.
Because each one will carry his own load.
And let him who is taught in the word share all good with the one who teaches him.
Don't be fooled; God cannot be mocked, because everything that man sows, that will also reap.
For he who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh; But he who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
Let us not get tired of doing good, because in due time we will reap, if we do not lose heart.
So, whenever we have the opportunity, let us do good to all, and especially to those of the family of faith.
Look how great letters I have written to you with my own hand.
All those who want to please in the flesh, these force you to be circumcised, only to avoid persecution because of the cross of Christ.
For even the circumcised themselves do not keep the law; but they want you to be circumcised, to glory in your flesh.
But far be it from me to boast, but on the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, for whom the world has been crucified for me, and I for the world.
Because in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision is worth anything, nor uncircumcision, but the new creature.
And to all who walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
From now on nobody bothers me, because I carry the marks of the Lord Jesus on my body.
Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
