I pray to the elders who are among you, I also an elder with them, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also partaker of the glory that will be revealed:
Feed the flock of God that is among you, taking care of it, not by force, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but with prompt encouragement;
not as having dominion over the Lord's flocks, but being examples of the flock.
And when the Prince of the Shepherds appears, you will receive the incorruptible crown of glory.
Similarly, young people, be subject to the elderly; and all submissive to each other, clothe yourselves with humility, because: God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,
casting all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.
Be sober, and watch, because your adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, walks around looking for someone to devour;
Resist him, standing firm in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions must be fulfilled in your brothers who are in the world.
But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory in Jesus Christ, after you have suffered a little while, he himself will perfect, affirm, strengthen and establish you.
To him be glory and dominion forever. Amen.
Through Silvano, whom I consider a faithful brother, I have written briefly, admonishing you and testifying that this is the true grace of God, in which you are.
The church that is in Babylon, chosen together with you, and Mark, my son, greet you.
Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Jesus Christ. Amen.
