And as co-workers with Him, we also exhort you not to receive God's grace in vain;
for He says: At the right time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is the right time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
Not giving us anything to stumble, so that the ministry is not discredited,
but in everything we recommend ourselves as ministers of God, in much perseverance, in afflictions, in privations, in anguishes,
in scourging, in jails, in riots, in jobs, in sleeplessness, in fasting,
in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in goodness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,
in the word of truth, in the power of God; for weapons of justice for the right and for the left;
in honor and disgrace, in bad name and in good name; like impostors, but truthful;
as unknown, but well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, but not sentenced to death;
as saddened, but always joyful; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, although possessing everything.
Our mouth, O Corinthians, has spoken to you quite frankly. Our hearts have been opened wide.
You are not limited by us, but you are limited in your feelings.
Now, in equal reciprocity (I speak to you as children) you also open your hearts wide.
Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what association do justice and iniquity have? Or what communion hath light with darkness?
Or what harmony does Christ have with Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
Or what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, as God said: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord; and do not touch the unclean, and I will receive you.
And I will be a father to you,
