When I came to you, brothers, proclaiming the testimony of God, I did not go with superiority of word or wisdom,
for I did not intend to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and this crucified man.
And I was among you with weakness, and with fear and much trembling.
And neither my message nor my preaching were with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
so that your faith does not rest in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
However, we speak wisdom among those who have reached maturity; but a wisdom not of this century, nor of the rulers of this century, who are disappearing,
but we speak wisdom of God in mystery, the hidden wisdom that, before the centuries, God predestined for our glory;
the wisdom that none of the rulers of this century has understood, because if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
but as it is written: Things that the eye did not see, nor the ear did they hear, Nor have they entered the heart of man, they are the things that God has prepared for those who love him.
But God revealed them to us through the Spirit, because the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
For among men, who knows the thoughts of a man but the spirit of the man who is in him? Likewise, no one knows the thoughts of God but the Spirit of God.
And we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we know what God has freely given us,
of which we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.
But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, because for him they are foolishness; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
Instead, he who is spiritual judges all things; but he is not judged by anyone.
For who has known the mind of the Lord to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
