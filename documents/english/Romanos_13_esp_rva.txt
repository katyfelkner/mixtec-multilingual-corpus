Let everyone submit to the higher authorities because there is no authority that does not come from God; and those that exist have been established by God.
So whoever opposes authority opposes what is constituted by God; and those who oppose will receive condemnation for themselves.
Because the rulers are not to instill terror in those who do good but in those who do evil. Do you want to not fear authority? Do what is good and you will have his praise
because he is a servant of God for your good. But if you do wrong, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain, for he is a servant of God, an avenger for punishment of him who does evil.
Therefore, it is necessary that they are subject, not only for punishment, but also for reasons of conscience.
Because for this they also pay taxes, because the rulers are ministers of God who attend to this very thing.
Pay everyone what you owe: tribute, tribute; to which tax, tax; whom I respect, respect; who honors, honors.
They owe nothing to anyone except loving one another, because he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
Because the commandments — you will not commit adultery, you will not commit murder, you will not steal [a], you will not covet [b], and any other commandment — are summed up in this sentence: You will love your neighbor as yourself [c].
Love does no harm to neighbor; so love is the fulfillment of the law.
And do this knowing the time, that it is time to wake up from the dream, because now salvation is closer to us than when we believed.
The night is well advanced, and the day is near. So let us divest ourselves of the works of darkness and put on the weapons of light.
Let us walk decently, as of day; not with gluttony and drunkenness nor in sexual sins and debauchery nor in quarrels and envy.
Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision to satisfy the evil desires of the flesh.
