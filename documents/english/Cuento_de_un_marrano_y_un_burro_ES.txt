Tale of a pig and a donkey
One day a pig found a donkey carrying firewood and said:
"Why are you carrying so much firewood when you're so skinny?"
"Because my master needs it," replied the donkey.
-That's why?
But I don't work, and even so, as well; they feed me three times a day.
Look at my neck and my sides; I am pure good meat.
But you are pure bones, ”said the pig to the donkey.
"Ah, I remember," said the donkey.
I just heard my owner talking about killing a pig for food.
That is why they need this firewood, to cook the meat of that pig.
-It's true what you say? Asked the pig.
Because if I'm the one who's going to kill, there is no reason for us to keep talking anymore.
I must be the pig they talk about, because there is no other here.
I will be tasty, because my meat will smell very good when they put me on the table. But, poor you, when you die and they throw you, the buzzards will eat you,
because you are very skinny and your entrails smell very ugly - the pig told the donkey.
"What you say may be true," replied the donkey.
"I have to go now, because the knife has already been sharpened; so,
you and I will not see each other anymore until we are in the other world,
because the buzzards are going to eat you, and the people are going to eat me, ”said the pig to the donkey.
And so this story ends.
