For this reason I, Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus for the love of you Gentiles
(if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me for you;
that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, just as I wrote briefly before.
In view of which, reading, you will be able to understand my discernment of the mystery of Christ,
that in other generations it was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to their holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
namely, that the Gentiles are joint heirs and members of the same body, participating equally in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace that has been granted to me according to the efficacy of his power.
To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was granted me: to announce to the Gentiles the inscrutable riches of Christ,
and to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery that for centuries has been hidden in God, creator of all things;
so that the infinite wisdom of God may now be made known through the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions,
according to the eternal purpose that was accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have freedom and access to God with confidence through faith in Him.
Therefore I pray that you will not lose heart because of my tribulations for you, because they are your glory.)
For this reason, then, I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name,
that he grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man;
so that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; and that rooted and grounded in love,
you are able to understand with all the saints what is the width, the length, the height and the depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
And to him who is able to do everything much more abundantly than we ask or understand, according to the power that works in us,
to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
