Clarified last night.
All night the moon shone.
It is cloudy again.
And there is wind.
Maybe it's going to rain again.
It's really cold.
I recently heard it rumble.
A while ago when I woke up there was a lot of lightning.
In the morning it was flashing a lot.
Now little did the coyotes shout too.
Maybe they announced the hail.
