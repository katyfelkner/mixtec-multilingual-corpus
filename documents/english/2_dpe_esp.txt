What are indigenous peoples and communities?
Indigenous peoples are "those who descend from populations that inhabited the current territory of the country at the beginning of colonization and who retain their own, or part of them, social, economic, cultural and political institutions."
Indigenous communities are "those that form a social, economic and cultural unit, settled in a territory and that recognize their own authorities according to their uses and customs." Article 2 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States.
Most of the indigenous communities in Mexico base their organization on:
A collective territory, recognized as ancestral.
Decision making collectively in a general assembly.
The office system, in which the assembly assigns tasks that can be civil, religious, communal or others, that are carried out for the benefit of the community.
The tequio or faena, which is collective work in favor of the community.
Festivals and rites, which serve as an important element of social union.
