Therefore, holy brothers, participants in the heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.
He was faithful to the one who constituted him, as was Moses in all the house of God.
But he has been deemed worthy of a glory greater than that of Moses, for he who has built a house has greater dignity than the house.
Because every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.
Moses was faithful as a servant in all the house of God to give testimony of what was to be said later.
Instead, Christ is faithful as a Son over his house. This house is hers, if we really retain [a] confidence and glory in hope.
So, as the Holy Spirit says: If you hear his voice today,
do not harden your heart as in provocation, on the day of trial in the desert,
where your parents put me to the test and saw my works for forty years.
For this reason I was angry with that generation and said: "They always stray in their hearts and have not known my ways."
As I swore in my anger: "They will never enter my rest!" [B].
Look, brothers, that there is not in any of you an evil heart of unbelief that departs from the living God.
Rather, exhort each other every day while still saying, "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the delusion of sin.
Because we have become participants in Christ, if we truly retain the beginning of our trust to the end,
meanwhile it is said: If you hear his voice today, do not harden your heart as in provocation [c].
For who were those who, having heard, provoked it? Were not all those who left Egypt with Moses?
And who were you upset with for forty years? Was it not precisely with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest but to those who did not obey?
And we see that they could not enter because of their unbelief.
