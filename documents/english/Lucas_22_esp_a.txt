The feast of unleavened bread, called Easter, was approaching.
And the main priests and scribes were looking for how to kill Jesus, because they feared the people.
Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who belonged to the number of twelve;
and he went and discussed with the chief priests and with the officers how he would be delivered.
They were happy and agreed to give him money.
He accepted, and was looking for an opportunity to hand him over, without making a fuss.
The day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread arrived, when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.
Then Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.
They said to him: Where do you want us to prepare it?
And He answered them, Behold, when you enter the city, a man will come to meet you, carrying a pitcher of water; follow him to the house where he enters.
And you will say to the owner of the house: "The Master says to you:" Where is the room, in which I can eat Easter with my disciples? "".
Then he will show you a great room, high, ready; prepare it there.
So they went and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
When the hour came, he sat at the table, and with him the apostles,
And he said to them: I have desired to eat this Passover with you before suffering;
because I tell you that I will never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
And having a drink, after giving thanks, he said: Take this and divide it among yourselves;
For I tell you that from now on I will not drink the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
And having taken bread, after having given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to them, saying: This is my body which is given for you; Do this in remembrance of me.
In the same way he took the cup after supper, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.
But behold, the hand of the bearer is with me on the table.
For in truth, the Son of Man goes as determined, but woe to that man by whom He is delivered!
Then they began to argue among themselves which of them would be the one to do this.
An altercation also arose between them, about which of them should be considered the greatest.
And Jesus said to them: The kings of the Gentiles rule over them; and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.
But it is not so with you; Before, the greatest among you become as the least, and the one who leads as the one who serves.
Because which is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is not he who sits at the table? However, among you I am like the one who serves.
You are the ones who have stayed with me in my trials;
and just as my Father has granted me a kingdom, I grant you
that you eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Simon, Simon, see that Satan has claimed you to shake you like wheat;
but I have prayed for you so that your faith does not fail; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.
And Peter said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.
But Jesus said to him: I tell you, Peter, that the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me.
And he said to them: When I sent you without a bag, or a saddlebag, or sandals, was there anything missing? And they answered: No, nothing.
Then he said to them: But now, whoever has a bag, let him carry it with him, in the same way also a saddlebag, and whoever does not have a sword, sell his cloak and buy one.
Because I tell you that it is necessary for me to fulfill what is written: "AND WITH THE TRANSGRESSORS HE WAS TOLD"; Well, certainly, as regards me, it has its fulfillment.
And they said, Lord, look, here are two swords. And He said to them: It is enough.
And leaving, he went, as usual, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.
When he arrived at the place, he said to them: Pray that you do not enter temptation.
And he withdrew from them like a stone's throw, and kneeling down, he prayed,
saying: Father, if it is your will, take this cup away from me; but not my will, but yours be done.
Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
And being in agony, he prayed with great fervor; and his sweat became like thick drops of blood, falling on the ground.
When he got up from praying, he went to the disciples and found them asleep because of sadness,
And he said to them: Why do you sleep? Arise and pray that you will not be tempted.
While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and approached Jesus to kiss Him.
But Jesus said to him: Judas, do you give the Son of Man with a kiss?
And when those around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
Jesus answered and said: Stop! Enough of this. And touching the servant's ear, he healed him.
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, to the temple officials, and to the elders who had come against Him: Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a thief?
When I was with you every day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours.
Having arrested him, they took him away and led him to the high priest's house; but Pedro followed him from afar.
After they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and sat together, Peter sat among them.
And a servant girl, seeing him sitting by the fire, paying close attention to him, said: This man was also with him.
But he denied it, saying: Woman, I don't know him.
A little later, when another one saw him, he said: You are also one of them! But Pedro said: Man, isn't it!
After about an hour, another insisted, saying: Certainly this one was also with Him, because he is also a Galilean.
But Pedro said: Man, I don't know what you're talking about. And instantly, while he was still talking, a rooster crowed.
Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him: Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.
And going out, he wept bitterly.
The men who had Jesus in custody made fun of him and beat him;
and blindfolded him, they asked him, saying: Guess who is the one who hit you?
They also said many other things against Him, blaspheming.
When daylight came, the council of the village elders gathered, both the chief priests and the scribes, and they brought Jesus before their council, saying:
If you are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them: If I tell you, you will not believe;
and if I ask you, you will not answer.
But from now on, THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power of GOD.
They all said: So, you are the Son of God? And He answered them: You say that I am.
And they said: What need do we already have of testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.
