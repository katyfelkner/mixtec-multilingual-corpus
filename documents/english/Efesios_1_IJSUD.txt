Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are in Ephesus:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ,
as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and blameless before him, in love,
having predestined us to be adopted as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the pleasure of his will,
in praise of the glory of his grace, with which he has favored us in the Beloved.
In whom we have redemption by his blood, the remission of sins according to the riches of his grace,
who made us abound in all wisdom and intelligence,
making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his complacency, which he had proposed in himself,
of gathering all things in Christ, in the dispensation of the fulness of times, both those in heaven and those on earth.
In him, likewise, we obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of the one who does all things according to the design of his will,
so that we may be in praise of his glory, we who first hoped in Christ.
In him you also hoped, having heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in him also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
who is the guarantee of our inheritance, for the redemption of the possession acquired in praise of his glory.
Therefore I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and of your love for all the saints,
I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,
so that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
lighting up the eyes of your understanding, so that you know what is the hope that he has called you, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
and what the super-eminent greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the operation of the force of his power,
who exercised in Christ, raising him from the dead, and placing him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
over all principality and authority, and power and lordship, and over every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in the world to come.
And he subdued all things under his feet, and gave him over all things to the church,
which is his body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in everything.
