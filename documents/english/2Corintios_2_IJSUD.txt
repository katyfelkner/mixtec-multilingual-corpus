This, then, I determined for myself, not to come to you again with sadness.
For if I grieve you, who will be the one who cheers me up later, but he whom I have grieved?
For this reason I wrote to you, so that when I arrive, I will not have sadness on the part of those who should rejoice me, trusting you all that my joy is yours.
Because of the great tribulation and anguish of the heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be grieved, but so that you would know how much love I have for you.
If anyone has caused me sadness, it has not caused me alone, but to a certain extent, not to exaggerate, all of you.
Such a rebuke made by many suffices for such a person;
so, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, so that he is not consumed by too much sadness.
So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
Because also for this purpose I wrote to you, to have the proof of whether you are obedient in everything.
And whom you forgive, I also, because I too, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for you I have done it in the presence of Christ,
so that Satan does not take advantage of us, because we are not unaware of his machinations.
When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, although the door was opened to me in the Lord,
I had no rest in my spirit, for not having found Tito, my brother. So, saying goodbye to them, I left for Macedonia.
But thanks be to God, who makes us always triumph in Christ Jesus, and who through us manifests everywhere the fragrance of his knowledge.
For to God we are the pleasant scent of Christ in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
these certainly smell of death for death, and those smell of life for life. And for these things, who is enough?
Because we are not, like many, merchants who corrupt the word of God, but sincerely, as from God, before God, we speak in Christ.
