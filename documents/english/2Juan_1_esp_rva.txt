The old man to the chosen lady and her children, whom I truly love - and not only me, but also all who have known the truth -
because of the truth that remains in us and that will be with us forever:
Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us [a] in truth and love.
I was very happy to find among your children those who walk in the truth, according to the commandment we have received from the Father.
And now I beg you, madam, not as if I were writing you a new commandment but the same one we had from the beginning: that we love one another.
And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment in which you must walk, as you have heard from the beginning.
Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
See for yourselves so that you do not lose [b] the things we have worked on [c] but receive [d] abundant rewards.
Everyone who goes astray and does not remain in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who remains in doctrine has the Father and also the Son.
If someone comes to you and does not carry this doctrine, do not receive them at home or say: "Welcome!".
Because he who welcomes you participates in his evil deeds.
Although I have many things to write to you, I did not want to communicate them through paper and ink. Rather, I look forward to being with you and speaking face to face so that our joy is complete.
The children of your chosen sister greet you [e].
