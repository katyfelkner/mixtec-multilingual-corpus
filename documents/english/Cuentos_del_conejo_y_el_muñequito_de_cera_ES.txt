The Rabbit and the Wax Doll
Here we are going to tell one of the tales of the rabbit and the coyote.
There was a granny who planted beans.
But every morning a bunny ate his seedlings.
Then the grandmother went with a wise old man to advise her, and asked:
-What I am going to do?
A bunny is eating my cornfield.
And he replied:
"Go buy some wax; and with that wax, make a doll and put it there in the cornfield.
She bought the wax and did just as the old wise man had told her.
The next day, the bunny arrived at the cornfield.
-What are you looking for here? The bunny said to the doll.
Get out of my way, because you scare me, ‚Äùsaid the bunny to the doll.
Then the bunny kicked him and the doll fell, and it fell apart.
Well, the grandmother went again with the wise old man and said:
"The wax doll didn't work."
The bunny tore him to pieces.
"What wax did you buy?"
The man said to him.
"I bought white wax."
"That's not the one I should have bought."
He must have bought yellow wax.
So granny went to buy wax again, but now she bought yellow beeswax.
Then he made a doll again and put it in the cornfield.
When the bunny returned, he said to the doll:
-What are you doing here?
Step aside, because you scare me.
The bunny kicked the doll, but now its leg was stuck.
"Let go of my leg!"
Let go of my leg!
I still have my other leg and I'm going to kick you.
The bunny kicked it with its other paw, and it stuck to it, too.
"Let go or I'll hit you," he said, "I still have my hands."
Then he hit the doll with his hand, and his hand hit him.
He hit it with the other hand, and all four legs stuck to it.
Then he hit him with his mouth, and his mouth stuck to him; then with the ears and the tail, and everything stuck together.
The next day when the morning dawned, Grandma came to take care of her beans.
