Because every high priest taken from among men is constituted in favor of men in the things that refer to God, to present offerings and sacrifices for sins;
and he can act kindly towards the ignorant and misguided, since he himself is subject to weaknesses;
and for that reason he is obliged to offer sacrifices for sins, both for himself and for the people.
And no one takes this honor for himself, but receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.
In the same way, Christ did not glorify himself to become High Priest, but rather he glorified him who said to him: You are my son, I have begotten you today;
as it also says in another passage: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
Christ, in the days of his flesh, having offered prayers and supplications with great cry and tears to the one who could deliver him from death, was heard because of his reverent fear;
and although he was a Son, he learned obedience for what he suffered;
and having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
being constituted by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
We have a lot to say about this, and it is difficult to explain, since you have been slow to hear.
For although you should already be teachers, again you need someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
Because everyone who drinks only milk is not used to the word of justice, because he is a child.
But solid food is for adults, who by practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.
