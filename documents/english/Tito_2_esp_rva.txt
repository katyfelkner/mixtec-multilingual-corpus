But you speak what is in accordance with sound doctrine;
May the older men be sober, serious and prudent, healthy in faith, love and perseverance.
Likewise, that older women be reverent in conduct, not slanderers or slaves to much wine, teachers of good things,
so that young women are guided in prudence: to love their husband and children,
to be prudent and chaste, to be good housewives, to be subject to your own husband so that the word of God is not discredited.
He also exhorts young people to be prudent,
showing you everything as an example of good works. Show integrity, seriousness in your teaching
and a sound and blameless word so that the one who opposes us will be ashamed having nothing bad to say about any of us.
He exhorts servants to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be complacent and not responsive,
that they do not defraud but that they demonstrate all good faith so that in everything they adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.
Because the saving grace of God has been manifested to all men
teaching us to live prudently, justly and piously in the present age, renouncing impiety and worldly passions,
waiting for the blessed hope, the manifestation of the glory of the great God and Savior our Jesus Christ
who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own, zealous for good works.
These things speak, exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one belittle you!
