After this I looked, and saw an open door in heaven; and the first voice that I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking to me, said: Come up here and I will show you the things that must happen after these.
Instantly I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne placed in heaven, and one sitting on the throne.
And the one who sat was like a stone of jasper and sardium, and around the throne was a rainbow, like the emerald.
And around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and sitting on the thrones, twenty-four old men dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads.
From the throne came lightning, voices, and thunder; and before the throne were seven lamps of burning fire, which are the seven Spirits of God.
In front of the throne was like a transparent sea like glass; and in the middle of the throne and around the throne, four living beings full of eyes in front and behind.
The first living being was like a lion; the second being was like a calf; the third being had the face of a man, and the fourth being was like a flying eagle.
And the four living beings, each of them with six wings, were full of eyes around and inside, and day and night they did not stop saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, it is the Lord God, the Almighty, the one who was, the one who is and the one who is to come.
And every time the living beings give glory, honor and thanksgiving to the one who sits on the throne, to the one who lives for ever and ever,
the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who sits on the throne, and worship the one who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
You are worthy, Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power, because you created all things, and by your will they exist and were created.
