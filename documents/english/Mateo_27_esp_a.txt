When morning came, all the chief priests and the village elders held counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
And after they bound him, they took him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Then Judas, the one who had delivered him, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
saying: I have sinned by delivering innocent blood. But they said: What to us? Over there you!
And he, throwing the silver pieces into the sanctuary, left; and went and hanged himself.
And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said: It is not lawful to put them in the treasure of the temple, since it is the price of blood.
And after holding a council, they bought the Potter's Field with them for burial by outsiders.
So that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.
Then what was announced through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, when he said: AND THEY TAKEN THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF WHICH PRICE HAD BEEN SET BY the children of Israel;
AND THEY GIVEN THEM THROUGH THE POTTER'S FIELD, AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED ME.
And Jesus appeared before the governor, and he questioned him, saying: Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him: You say so.
And being accused by the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate * said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?
And Jesus didn't answer a single question, so the governor was very amazed.
Now, at each party, the governor used to release a prisoner to the people, whoever they wanted.
And then they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
Therefore, when they met, Pilate said to them: Who do you want me to release to you: Barabbas or Jesus, called the Christ?
Because he knew that they had delivered him out of envy.
And while he was sitting in court, his wife sent him notice, saying: Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because today I have suffered a lot in dreams because of him.
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
And the governor answered and said to them: Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they answered: Barabbas.
Pilate * said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus, called the Christ?" They all said *: Be crucified!
And Pilate said: Why? What wrong has he done? But they screamed even more, saying: Be crucified!
And when Pilate saw that he was achieving nothing, but was rather forming a riot, he drank water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; There you go!
And all the people answered and said: Let their blood fall on us and on our children!
Then he released Barabbas to them, but after Jesus had him flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.
Then the governor's soldiers brought Jesus to the Praetorium, and gathered around him the entire Roman cohort.
And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak on him.
And weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
And spitting on him, they took the cane and hit him on the head.
After mocking Him, they took off His cloak, put His clothes on Him, and took Him away to crucify Him.
And when they were leaving, they found a Cyrene man named Simon, whom they forced to carry the cross.
When they got to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of the Skull,
they made him drink wine mixed with gall; but after trying it, he didn't want to drink it.
And having crucified Him, they divided their clothes, casting lots;
and sitting down they guarded him there.
And they put on his head the accusation against Him, which said: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Then two thieves were crucified * with him, one on the right and one on the left.
Those who passed insulted him, shaking their heads
And saying: You who destroy the temple and in three days rebuild it, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross.
In the same way, also the main priests, along with the scribes and the elders, mocking Him, said:
He saved others; You cannot save yourself. King of Israel is; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.
IN GOD TRUST; TO RELEASE you now IF HE WANTS YOU; because he said: "I am the Son of God".
In the same way the thieves who had been crucified with Him also insulted Him.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.
And around the ninth hour, Jesus exclaimed with a loud voice, saying: ELÍ, ELÍ, LEMA SABACTANI? This is: MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU DENIED ME?
Some of those who were there, when they heard it, said: This one calls Elijah.
And at once one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it in vinegar, and putting it on a reed, gave him to drink.
But the others said: Leave, let's see if Elías comes to save him.
Then Jesus, crying out again with a loud voice, breathed out the spirit.
And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks split;
and the graves were opened, and the bodies of many sleeping saints were resurrected;
and leaving the tombs, after the resurrection of Jesus, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
When the centurion and those who were with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, they were very scared, and said: Truly this was the Son of God.
And many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve Him, were there, looking from afar;
among which were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
And in the evening, a wealthy man from Arimathea came, named Joseph, who had also become a disciple of Jesus.
He presented himself to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be delivered to him.
Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
And he put it in his new grave that he had excavated in the rock, and after rolling a large stone at the entrance of the grave, he left.
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting in front of the grave.
The next day, which is the day after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate,
and they said to him: Lord, we remember that when that deceiver was still alive, he said: "After three days I will rise again."
Therefore, he orders that the grave be secured until the third day, lest his disciples come, steal it, and say to the people: "He has risen from the dead"; and the last deception will be worse than the first.
Pilate said to them: You have a guard; go, secure it as you know.
And they went and made the grave secure; and in addition to putting the guard, they sealed the stone.
