Now the main point of what has been said is this: we have such a High Priest, who has sat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
as a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord erected, not man.
Because every High Priest is constituted to present offerings and sacrifices, so it is necessary that he also have something to offer.
So if He were on earth, He would not even be a priest, there being priests who present offerings according to the law;
which serve what is a copy and shadow of heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; Well, He says: Look, do all things according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.
But now He has obtained a so much better ministry, because He is also the mediator of a better covenant, established on better promises.
For if that first covenant had been without defect, no place would have been sought for the second.
For reproaching them, He says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, in which I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
not like the pact I made with their parents the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not remain in my covenant, and I ignored them, says the Lord.
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their minds, and write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they will be my people.
And none of them will teach his fellow citizen or any of his brother, saying: "Know the Lord", because all will know me, from the youngest to the oldest of them.
For I will have mercy on his iniquities, and I will never again remember his sins.
When He said: A new covenant, He made the first one out of date; and what becomes old-fashioned and aging is about to disappear.
