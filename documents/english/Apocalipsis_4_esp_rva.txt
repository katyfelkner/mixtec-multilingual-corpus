After this I looked, and behold an open door in heaven. The first voice I heard was like a trumpet speaking to me saying: "Come up here, and I will show you the things that will happen after these!".
Immediately I was in the Spirit [a]; and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.
And the one who sat was like a jasper and carnelian stone; and around the throne, a rainbow similar to the aspect of the emerald.
Also around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and on the thrones, twenty-four seated elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads.
Lightning and thunder and voices come from the throne. And before the throne seven flaming torches burn, which are the seven Spirits of God.
And before the throne is like a sea of ​​glass, similar to glass. Next to and around the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
The first living being is like a lion, and the second living being is like a calf, and the third living being is like a man, and the fourth living being is like a flying eagle.
And each of the four living creatures has six wings, and around and inside are full of eyes. Neither day nor night they stop saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!" [B].
And every time the living beings give [c] glory, honor and praise to the one who sits on the throne and lives forever and ever,
the twenty-four elders prostrate [d] before him who sits on the throne and worship [e] him who lives forever and ever; and they cast [f] their crowns before the throne, saying:
"You are worthy, O Lord and our God, to receive the glory, the honor and the power; because you have created all things, and by your will they have been and were created".
