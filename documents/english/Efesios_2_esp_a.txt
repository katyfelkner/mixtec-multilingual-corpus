And He gave life to you who were dead in your crimes and sins,
in which you once walked according to the current of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now operates in the children of disobedience,
among whom also all of us once lived in the passions of our flesh, satisfying the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just like the others.
But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
even when we were dead in our crimes, he gave us life together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
and with him he raised us up, and with him he sat us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
in order to be able to show in the coming centuries the superabundant riches of his grace for his goodness to us in Christ Jesus.
For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves, but from God;
not by works, so that no one can boast.
Because we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
Remember, then, that once you Gentiles in the flesh, called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision, made by hands in the flesh,
remember that at that time you were separated from Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope, and without God in the world.
But now in Christ Jesus, you, who were once far away, have been drawn near by the blood of Christ.
Because He Himself is our peace, who of both peoples made one, breaking down the intermediate wall of separation,
abolishing enmity in his flesh, the law of the commandments expressed in ordinances, to create in himself of the two a new man, thus establishing peace,
and to reconcile the two in one body with God by means of the cross, having killed enmity therein.
AND HE CAME AND ANNOUNCED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;
for through Him we both have our entrance into the Father in the same Spirit.
So you are no longer strangers or foreigners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and you are of the family of God,
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,
in whom the whole building, well adjusted, grows to be a holy temple in the Lord,
in whom you also are built together for dwelling of God in the Spirit.
