Wolf spider
There is a type of spider called tintoo savi.
She loads her eggs in a "white shawl"
'And when (the eggs) break'
get on his back
She takes great care of her children
because she is a good mom.
In my town they believe
it's wrong to kill the wolf spider
because if you kill her
you are struck by lightning.
That's what they believe in the town where I live
Reaper
They say in my town
that when a reaper passes in front of us
problems come
They also say
that we are going to get money
That is what they count.
Do you know why the reaper does not have all the legs firmly fixed
It is because every time an insect approaches to attack it
removes one leg and pulls it toward the insect
Then the leg starts to move by itself
the insect is scared and entertains looking at the leg
and suddenly, the reaper jumps and kills the insect.
