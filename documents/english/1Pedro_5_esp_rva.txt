To the elders among you I exhort, I also an elder with them, witness of the sufferings of Christ and also partaker of the glory that is to be revealed:
They show the flock of God that is in their charge, taking care of it not by force but of good will according to God; not for dishonest gain but from the heart;
not as having lordship over those in charge but as examples for the flock.
And when the Prince of the Shepherds appears, they will receive the unstoppable crown of glory.
Likewise, young people, be subject to the elderly and all clothe yourselves with humility towards each other because: God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble [a].
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that he may exalt you in due time.
Cast all your anxiety on him because he takes care of you.
Be sober and watch. His adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, walks around looking for someone to devour.
Resist such by standing firm in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being fulfilled among your brothers throughout the world.
And when you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will himself restore you, affirm you, strengthen you, and establish you.
To him be the domain [b] forever. Amen.
I have written briefly to you through Silas, whom I consider a faithful brother, to exhort and testify that this is the true grace of God. Be firm in it.
The church in Babylon greets you, chosen together with you; also Marcos, my son.
Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ [c].
