The turtle Luis found
Luis found a turtle where the earth was crumbling,
and he said to Benito:
"Nito, look!" a turtle.
-Really? Nito asked.
"Look at it for yourself," Luis replied.
So Luis found the turtle. Then he took a stone and started hitting it on the shell.
Benito started laughing.
Then Luis said to him:
"He plucks an ear to see if we can get him something to eat."
So Benito plucked an ear and they started feeding the turtle,
but she did not want to eat because she was afraid that they would eat her.
Luis said again to Nito:
"Get some cheese out of my bag;
see if you eat that.
Benito went and took the cheese out of Luis's backpack and they started giving it to him, but the turtle still didn't want to eat.
Then Luis said:
"â€”Now, make us a campfire and we'll cook it, so we can eat it."
Benito made the fire, but then asked
"How are we going to cook it if we don't have a pot?"
Then he replied:
"We can use a gourd." Go find three stones in the river and bring them
Luis replied.
Benito went to look for the stones and when Luis returned he put them on fire.
When the stones became very, very red, he took them out of the fire and put them in a jug full of water.
That was how they finally cooked the turtle and ate it. They were very happy to eat the meat of the turtle.
