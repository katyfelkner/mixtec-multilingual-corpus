At dawn, all the chief priests and the village elders took counsel against Jesus to hand him over to death.
And after binding him, they took him away and handed him over to Pilate the procurator.
Then Judas, who had delivered him, upon seeing that he was condemned, felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
saying: —I have sinned by delivering innocent blood. But they said, "What does it matter to us?" It's your business!
Then he, throwing the silver pieces into the sanctuary, turned away, left, and hanged himself.
The chief priests, taking the silver pieces, said: "It is not lawful to put them in the treasury of the offerings, because it is the price of blood."
And having agreed, they bought with them the Potter's field, for burial of foreigners.
So that field is called Campo de Sangre until today.
Then what was said by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, when he said: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the precious one, according to the price fixed by the children of Israel;
And they gave them to the Potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.
Jesus stood in the presence of the procurator, and the procurator asked him, saying, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You say so."
And being accused by the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
He did not answer her a word, so the procurator was greatly amazed.
At the party, the attorney used to release a prisoner to the town, whoever they wanted.
At that time they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
When they were gathered together, Pilate said to them: "Which one do you want me to release?" Barabbas or Jesus, called the Christ?
Because he knew that out of envy they had delivered him.
While he was sitting in court, his wife told him to say: "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because today I have suffered many things in dreams because of him."
Then the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
And answering the attorney said: "Which of the two do you want me to release?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus, called the Christ?" They all said, "Be crucified!"
And the procurator said to them, "Well, what harm has he done?" But they screamed even louder saying: "Be crucified!"
And when Pilate realized that nothing was being accomplished but only making more fuss, he drank water and washed his hands in front of the crowd saying: "I am innocent of his blood!" It will be your business!
All the people answered and said: "His blood be on us and on our children!"
Then he released Barabbas to them and, after having scourged Jesus, handed him over to be crucified.
Then the procurator's soldiers brought Jesus to the Praetorium and gathered the entire company around him.
After undressing him, they put a scarlet cloak over him.
Having interwoven a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and in his right hand they put a reed. They knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Long live, King of the Jews!"
And spitting on him, they took the reed and beat him on the head.
When they made fun of him, they took off his cloak, put on his own clothes, and took him away to crucify him.
As they were leaving, they found a Cyrene man named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.
When they reached the place called Golgotha, which means the place of the Skull,
they gave him to drink wine mixed with wormwood; but when he tried it, he didn't want to drink it.
After crucifying him, they distributed their dresses, casting lots.
And sitting down, they kept him there.
They put their written accusation over his head: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
They then crucified two thieves with him, one on the right and one on the left.
Those who passed insulted him, shaking their heads
and saying: —You who demolish the temple and in three days build it, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross!
Similarly, even the chief priests along with the scribes and the elders made fun of him, saying:
—He saved others; You cannot save yourself. Is he king of Israel? Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him!
You have trusted God. Let him be free now if he wants to, because he said: "I am the Son of God."
The thieves who were crucified with him also insulted him in the same way.
From noon darkness descended on the whole earth until three in the afternoon.
At around three in the afternoon Jesus exclaimed with a loud voice saying: "Eli, Eli!" Lama sabactani ?, (this is: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?).
When some of those who were there heard him, they said: —This man calls Elijah.
And immediately one of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with vinegar and, putting it on a reed, gave him a drink.
But others said: —Let us see if Elías comes to save him.
But Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up the spirit.
And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.
The graves were opened and many bodies of holy men who had died rose;
and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went to the holy city and appeared to many.
And when the centurion and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were very afraid and said: —This was truly the Son of God!
Many women were there watching from afar. They had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
Among them were: Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
In the evening, a wealthy man from Arimathea came named Joseph, who had also been a disciple of Jesus.
He presented himself to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given.
José took the body, wrapped it in a clean sheet
And he put it in his new tomb which he had carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone to the entrance to the tomb and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting in front of the tomb.
The next day, that is, after Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate.
saying, "Sir, we remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'
So command the tomb to be secured until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal the body, and say to the people, "He is risen from the dead." And the last fraud will be worse than the first.
Pilate said to them, "They have troops on guard." Go and secure it as you know how to do it.
They went and, having sealed the stone, secured the grave with the guard.
