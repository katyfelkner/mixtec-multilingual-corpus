The old man to the much loved Gaius, whom I truly love.
Beloved, I desire that you prosper in all things and have health, just as your soul prospers.
Well, I was very happy when the brothers came and bore witness to the truth that is in you, how you walk in the truth.
I have no greater joy than this, hearing that my children walk in the truth.
Beloved, you faithfully act in everything you do to the brothers and to the foreigners,
those who have testified of your love in the presence of the church; and you will do well to direct them as it is worthy of God.
Because they went out because of his name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
We, therefore, must welcome such people, so that we are collaborators in the truth.
I have written to the church; but Diotrephes, who wishes to be the first among them, does not receive us.
For this reason, if I go, I will remember the works he does, chattering with evil words against us; and not content with these things, he does not receive the brothers, and he forbids those who want to receive them and expels them from the church.
Beloved, do not imitate evil, but good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God.
All bear good witness to Demetrius, and even the truth itself; And we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.
I had many things to write to you, but I don't want to write them to you in ink and pen,
because I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.
Peace be with you. Friends greet you. You greet each of the friends by name.
