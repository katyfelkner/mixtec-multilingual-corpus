Therefore, unable to bear it any longer, we thought it better to be alone in Athens,
and we send Timothy, our brother and collaborator of God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you with respect to your faith;
so that nobody worries about these afflictions, because you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
Because in truth, when we were with you we predicted that we would suffer affliction, and this has happened, as you know.
So I too, when I couldn't take it anymore, sent to inform myself of your faith, for fear that the tempter had tempted you and that our work would be in vain.
But now Timothy has returned from you to us, and has brought us good news of your faith and love and that you always have a good memory of us, longing to see us, as we also to you;
therefore, brothers, in all our need and affliction we were comforted with respect to you through your faith;
because now we do live, if you are firm in the Lord.
For what thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God because of you,
As we pray intensely at night and during the day that we can see your face and that we complete what is lacking in your faith?
Now, then, that the same God and our Father, and Jesus our Lord, direct our way to you;
and may the Lord make you grow and abound in love for each other, and for everyone, as we also do for you;
so that He may affirm your blameless hearts in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
