I saw another sign in heaven, great and admirable: seven angels who had the last seven plagues, with which the wrath of God is consummated.
I saw something like a sea of ​​glass mixed with fire and the victors over the beast and its image and its name number. They were standing on the sea of ​​glass, holding the harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: "Great and wonderful are your works, Lord God Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, King of the nations [a].
O Lord, who will not fear and glorify your name? Because only you are holy. All nations will come and worship before you; because your judgments have been manifested. "
After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of witness was opened in heaven;
And out of the sanctuary came the seven angels who had the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, gleaming linen, girded around the chest with gold bands.
And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
The temple was filled with smoke for the glory of God and for his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were consummated.
