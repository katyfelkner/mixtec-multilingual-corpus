And when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came into counsel against Jesus, to deliver him to death.
And they bound him and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
Then Judas, who had delivered him, seeing that he was condemned, repentedly returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
saying: I have sinned by delivering innocent blood. But they said: What does it matter to us? Over there you!
Then, throwing the silver pieces into the temple, he went out, and went and hanged himself.
And the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to cast them into the treasure, for it is the price of blood.
But after having deliberated, they bought with them the potter's field, for the burial of foreigners.
So that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then what was said by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, when he said: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the precious one, which was fixed by the children of Israel;
And they gave them to the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.
And Jesus was standing before the governor; And the governor asked him, saying: Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him: You say so.
And being accused by the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?
But Jesus did not answer him a word, so the governor was very amazed.
And, on the day of the party, the governor used to release a prisoner to the people, whoever they wanted.
And then they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
And when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ?
because he knew that out of envy they had delivered him.
And while he was sitting in court, his wife told him to say: Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because today I have suffered many things in dreams because of him.
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the people to ask Barabbas, and to kill Jesus.
And the governor answering said to them: Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said: Barabbas!
Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ? They all said to him: Be crucified!
And the governor said to them: Well, what wrong has he done? But they shouted more, saying: Be crucified!
And when Pilate saw that he was advancing nothing, but was making more fuss, he took water and washed his hands in front of the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this righteous one. Over there you!
And all the people answered and said: His blood be on us and on our children.
Then he released Barabbas; and having scourged Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus to the praetorium and gathered the whole company around him;
And stripping him, they put a scarlet robe on him;
and they put on his head a crown woven with thorns, and a reed in his right hand; And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
And spitting on him, they took the reed and beat him on the head.
And after they had mocked him, they took off his cloak and put his clothes on him and took him away to crucify him.
And when they came out, they found a Cyrenian named Simon; they forced him to carry the cross.
And when they got to the place called Golgotha, which means: Place of the Skull,
they gave him vinegar mixed with gall; but after trying it, he didn't want to drink it.
And after they had crucified him, they divided their clothes among themselves, casting lots, so that what was said by the prophet could be fulfilled: My clothes were distributed, and lots were cast on my clothes.
And sitting they guarded him there.
And they put their written accusation on his head: This IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
They then crucified two thieves with him, one on the right and one on the left.
And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,
And saying: You who demolish the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
In this way also the chief priests, mocking him with the scribes and the Pharisees and the elders, said:
He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.
I trust in God; Free him now if he loves you, because he said: I am the Son of God.
The thieves who were crucified with him also insulted him.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
And around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli! Lama Sabactani? This is: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
And some of those who were there, when they heard him, said: Call Elijah this.
And immediately one of them ran, took a sponge, and dipped it in vinegar, and put it on a reed, gave him a drink.
But the others said: Leave, let's see if El√≠as comes to deliver him.
But Jesus, having cried out again with a loud voice, gave up the spirit.
And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks split;
And the graves were opened, and many bodies of sleeping saints were raised;
and leaving the tombs, after the resurrection of Jesus, they came to the holy city and appeared to many.
And when the centurion and those who were with him guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had been done, they feared greatly and said: Truly this was the Son of God!
And there were many women watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,
among which were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
And in the evening, a wealthy man from Arimathea came, named Joseph, who had also been a disciple of Jesus.
This went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate commanded that he be given the body.
And Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean sheet
And he put it in his new grave, which he had carved out of the rock; and after he had rolled a great stone at the entrance to the grave, he went away.
And there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting in front of the grave.
And the next day, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate,
and they said to him: Lord, we remember that that deceiver said, still living: After three days I will rise again.
Therefore command the tomb to be secured until the third day; lest his disciples come by night, steal him and say to the people, He rose from the dead. And it will be worse than the first last error.
And Pilate said to them: There you have a guard; go, secure it as you know.
So they went and made the grave secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
