Tale of the fox who pretended to be dead
This happened to a fox:
entered a corral
where there were some chickens,
and there it was when it dawned,
and he could not leave without being seen.
When he saw that he couldn't hide,
he thought it would be good to be seen.
He left the corral and publicly threw himself on the road
pretending dead.
People didn't think he was alive,
I thought he was dead.
After a while a man passed
and saw it there.
Then she remembered what people say
which is very good the hair on the forehead of a fox
to put on the children's faces
so they don't get sick of something on their faces.
So he cut it and took it away. Then another happened
who cut off his mustaches and took them away.
Then another happened
who cut his nails to go.
Then another passed by who said:
"Teeth are very good for a sore mouth," he said.
Then he took them off and took them away.
They saw all its parts and took them off;
but he did not move at all;
there he was lying.
Then another passed by who spoke of removing his heart.
When he understood that they were going to take his heart out,
then he began to think:
"We better run.
That we no longer become the deceased,
so they don't rip our hearts out and we die, "he thought.
Then he ran; He did not allow his heart to be removed.
This story means that:
When people take advantage of us
and we are allowing them to,
If we know that we are not going to take it anymore,
then it is better to run from them
and not allow them to abuse us further.
