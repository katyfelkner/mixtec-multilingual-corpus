My brethren, do not become many of you teachers, knowing that we will receive greater condemnation.
Because we all offend in many ways. If anyone does not offend by word, this is a perfect man, also capable of restraining the whole body.
Behold, we put a brake on the horses' mouth so that they obey us, and thus direct their entire bodies.
Look also at the ships; Although so large, and carried by impetuous winds, they are governed with a very small rudder where the one who governs them wants.
So too the tongue is a small member, but it boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest kindles a small fire!
And the tongue is a fire, a world of evil. The tongue is placed between our limbs, and it contaminates the whole body, and it ignites the course of life, and it is ignited by hell.
For every species of beast, and of birds, and of serpents, and of creatures of the sea is tamed and has been tamed by the human being;
but no man can tame the tongue, which is an evil that cannot be restrained, full of deadly poison.
With it we bless God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the image of God.
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be like this.
Does any source pour fresh and bitter water through the same opening?
My brothers, can the fig tree produce olives, or the vine figs? Well, a fountain cannot give salty and sweet water either.
Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by good conduct your works in the meekness of wisdom.
But if you have bitter envy and contention in your hearts, do not boast or lie against the truth,
for this wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, animal, and devilish.
Because where there is envy and contention, there is confusion and every evil work.
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, kind, benign, full of mercy and good fruit, not judgmental or feigned.
And the fruit of justice is sown in peace for those who make peace.
