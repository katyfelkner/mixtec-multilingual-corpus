When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
Suddenly a noise came from the sky like that of a rushing wind that filled the whole house where they were sitting,
and tongues like fire appeared to them and, dividing themselves, they rested on each one of them.
All were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to express themselves.
And there were Jews who dwelt in Jerusalem, godly men, from every nation under heaven.
And when this roar occurred, the crowd gathered; and they were puzzled because each one heard them speak in their own language.
And they were amazed and amazed, saying: Look, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
How is it that each of us hears them speak in our language in which we were born?
Parthians, Medes and Elamites, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the Libyan regions around Cyrene, travelers from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speak in our languages ​​of the wonders of God.
Everyone was amazed and perplexed, saying to each other: What does this mean?
But others scoffed and said: They are drunk.
Then Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: Jewish men and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be your knowledge and pay attention to my words,
because these are not drunk as you suppose, because it is hardly the third hour of the day;
but this is what was said through the prophet Joel:
AND IT WILL HAPPEN IN THE LAST DAYS, says God, THAT I WILL SPILL OF MY SPIRIT ON ALL FLESH; AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR DAUGHTERS WILL PROPHETIZE, YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WILL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD PEOPLE WILL DREAM DREAMS;
AND EVEN OVER MY SERVANTS AND OVER MY SERVANTS I WILL POUR OUT OF MY SPIRIT IN THOSE DAYS, and they will prophesy.
AND I WILL SHOW WONDERS UP IN THE SKY AND SIGNS DOWN IN THE EARTH: BLOOD, FIRE AND COLUMN OF SMOKE.
THE SUN WILL BECOME DARKNESS AND THE MOON BLOOD, BEFORE THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAY OF THE LORD COMES.
AND IT WILL HAPPEN THAT EVERYONE WHO INVOICES THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.
Listen to these words, Israelite men: Jesus the Nazarene, a man confirmed by God among you with miracles, wonders and signs that God did in your midst through Him, as you yourselves know,
to this, delivered by the predetermined plan and the previous knowledge of God, you nailed a cross by the hands of the wicked and you killed him,
whom God raised from the dead, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was not possible for Him to come under her rule.
Because David says of Him: I ALWAYS SAW THE LORD IN MY PRESENCE; IT IS AT MY RIGHT HAND SO I WILL NOT BE MOVED.
THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE REJOICED; AND EVEN MY FLESH WILL REST IN HOPE;
FOR YOU WILL NOT LEAVE MY SOUL IN HADES, NOR WILL YOU ALLOW YOUR HOLY ONE TO SEE CORRUPTION.
YOU HAVE MADE ME KNOW THE PATHWAYS OF LIFE; YOU WILL FILL ME WITH JOY WITH YOUR PRESENCE.
Brothers, of the Patriarch David I can confidently tell you that he died and was buried, and his grave is with us to this day.
But being a prophet, and knowing that GOD HAD SWORN TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE,
He looked to the future and spoke of the resurrection of Christ, who was NOT ABANDONED IN HADES, NOR HIS Flesh SUFFERED CORRUPTION.
This Jesus God raised up, of which all of us are witnesses.
So, exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has poured out this which you see and hear.
Because David did not ascend to heaven, but he himself says: THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD: "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BY THE STRIP OF YOUR FEET. "
So let the whole house of Israel know with certainty that this Jesus whom you crucified, God has made Lord and Christ.
Hearing this, heartbroken, they said to Peter and the other apostles: Brothers, what shall we do?
And Peter said to them: Repent and be baptized each one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Because the promise is for you and your children and for all those who are far away, for as many as the Lord our God calls.
And with many other words he solemnly testified and exhorted them saying: Be saved from this wicked generation.
Then those who had received his word were baptized; and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
And they continually dedicated themselves to the teachings of the apostles, to communion, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.
Fear ensued to every person; and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
All who had believed were together and had all things in common;
They sold all their properties and assets and shared them with everyone, according to the needs of each one.
Day after day they continued unanimously in the temple and breaking bread in homes, they ate together with joy and simplicity of heart,
praising God and finding favor with all the people. And the Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved.
