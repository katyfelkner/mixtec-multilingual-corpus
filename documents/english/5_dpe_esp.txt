Political participation
In order to establish the territorial demarcation of the single-member electoral districts in the national territory, the location of indigenous peoples and communities should be taken into account, whenever possible, in order to favor their political participation.
Participation in national politics is also a right of indigenous peoples and, to make that a reality, twenty-eight (28) "indigenous districts" have been created, representing only 53% of the indigenous population. Likewise, of the people who have been elected in these districts, few belong to indigenous communities or self-register as such, similar to what Jaime Martínez Luna, community member of Guelatao de Juárez, Oaxaca, characterizes as "community representatives".
