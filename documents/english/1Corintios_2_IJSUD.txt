So, brothers, when I came to you to announce the testimony of God, I did not go with excellence of words or wisdom.
Well, I decided not to know anything among you but Jesus Christ and this crucified one.
And I was among you with weakness, and much fear and trembling;
and neither my word nor my preaching were with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
so that your faith was not founded on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
However, we speak wisdom among the perfect; and wisdom, not of this world, nor of the princes of this world, who perish.
But we speak wisdom of God in mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God destined before the centuries for our glory,
the one that none of the rulers of this world knew, because if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.
Rather, as it is written: Things that the eye has not seen, nor the ear has heard, nor have they ascended into the heart of man, are those that God has prepared for those who love him.
But God revealed them to us by the Spirit, because the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
For who of men knows the things of man but the spirit of man that is in him? So also no one knew the things of God, but the Spirit of God.
And we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we know what God has given us;
which we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, accommodating the spiritual to the spiritual.
But the natural man does not perceive the things that are of the Spirit of God, because for him they are madness, and he cannot understand them, because they have to be spiritually discerned.
Instead, the spiritual man judges all things, but he is not judged by anyone.
Because who knew the mind of the Lord? Who will instruct you? But we have the mind of Christ.
