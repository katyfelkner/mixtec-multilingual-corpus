Tale of the Vulture
It is said that a long time ago the vulture was a white dove.
Only back then there was a flood that lasted forty days and forty nights.
During the flood almost all the animals on earth died. Many people also died, and the trees that could not stand rotted with the water.
When the flood ended, the animals that had been saved were in the high part of the mountains, and it was they who said to the dove:
"You who can fly, see if there are still living animals in some part of the world."
The pigeon flew off to fulfill what they had ordered, but when he got to a part he saw that there were enough dead animals.
He stood on one of these animals and started pecking at it, and all the bad smell of the dead animal was smeared on his feathers.
Then he pecked at the belly of another animal and all the stinky water smeared on his feathers.
It stunk a lot, but the pigeon kept eating.
When she finally returned to where the other live animals were, these poor people did not recognize her and fled, because the pigeon stunk enough.
It was no longer white, it had turned black, because by eating dead animals it had lost its white feathers.
Since then it has that bad smell and lives apart from other animals.
He eats dead animals and does not care what disease they died of;
and it doesn't get together with good animals.
If you see a buzzard now, you will notice that its feather is black, in addition to having a very bad smell.
