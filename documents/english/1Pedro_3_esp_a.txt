Likewise, you women, be subject to your husbands, so that if some of them are disobedient to the word, they can be won without a word for the behavior of their wives
by observing your chaste and respectful conduct.
And that your decoration is not external: ostentatious hairstyles, gold jewelry or luxurious dresses,
but be the inner self, with the incorruptible adornment of a tender and serene spirit, which is precious before God.
For thus also the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, being subject to their husbands.
So Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her daughters, if you do good and are not frightened by any fear.
And you, husbands, likewise, live comprehensively with your wives, as with a more fragile glass, since she is a woman, giving her honor as a co-heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers are not hindered.
In conclusion, all be of the same mind, compassionate, fraternal, merciful and humble in spirit;
not returning evil for evil, or insult for insult, but rather blessing, because you were called for the purpose of inheriting blessing.
Well, THE ONE WHO WANTS TO LOVE LIFE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, RESTRAINS HIS TONGUE OF EVIL AND HIS LIPS DO NOT SPEAK DECEPTION.
DEPART FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; LOOK FOR PEACE AND FOLLOW IT.
FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE ON THE RIGHTEOUS, AND THEIR EARS ATTENTION TO THEIR PRAYERS; BUT THE LORD'S FACE IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.
And who can harm you if you show zeal for what is good?
But even if you suffer for justice, you are blessed. AND DON'T BE FEARED BY THEM FOR FEAR OF THEM OR DISTURBED,
but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being prepared to present defense before all those who demand reason of the hope that is in you, but do it with meekness and reverence;
having a good conscience, so that in what you are slandered, those who slander your good conduct in Christ will be ashamed.
For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is the will of God, than for doing evil.
Because Christ also died for sins only once, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God, dead in the flesh but quickened in the spirit;
in which he also went and preached to the imprisoned spirits,
who were once disobedient when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight people, were saved by means of water.
And corresponding to this, baptism now saves you (not by removing the dirt from the flesh, but as a petition to God for a good conscience) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
who is at the right hand of God, having ascended into heaven after angels, authorities, and powers had been brought before him.
