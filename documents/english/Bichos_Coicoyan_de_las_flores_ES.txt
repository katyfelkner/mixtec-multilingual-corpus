Sauce insect
that's what we call them
because when we eat them
they sting like sauce.
From ancient times, our ancestors grabbed them on the hills of green grass and blue flowers.
[The people] were fuming
and [the insects] flew away
that's how they got hold of them.
They removed their antennas
and they blew him in the "noses" [of bedbugs]
so it wouldn't throw away all its spicy liquid.
We can eat these "sauce" bugs alone
or we can pop them on a plate of beans
they leave a very rich smell in our food.
The months in which we can catch them are in March, April and May '
because when the rains start
[in that season] there are other bedbugs.
Similar to the sauce bug
but they smell really bad
and they have horns.
They are bad to eat.
