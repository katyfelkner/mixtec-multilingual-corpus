So, my brothers, loved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved.
I beg Evodia and Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.
In truth, faithful companion, I also ask you to help these women who have shared my struggles in the cause of the gospel, together with Clemente and my other collaborators, whose names are in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say it: rejoice!
May your goodness be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Be anxious for nothing; rather, in everything, through prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
For the rest, brothers, everything that is true, everything worthy, everything just, everything pure, everything kind, everything honorable, if there is any virtue or something that deserves praise, meditate on this.
What you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice this, and the God of peace will be with you.
I was greatly glad in the Lord that you have finally revived your care for me; in truth, before you worried, but you lacked the opportunity.
Not that I speak because I have a shortage, because I have learned to be content whatever my situation is.
I know how to live in poverty, and I know how to live in prosperity; in everything and everything I have learned the secret of being satiated as well as being hungry, of having abundance and of suffering need.
I can do everything in Christ who strengthens me.
However, you have done well to share with me in my distress.
And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in a matter of giving and receiving, but you alone;
because even to Thessalonica you sent gifts more than once for my needs.
It is not that I seek the gift itself, but that I seek fruit that increases your account.
But I have received everything and I have abundance; I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent: fragrant aroma, acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
And my God will supply all your needs, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
To our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
All the saints greet you, especially those from Caesar's house.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
