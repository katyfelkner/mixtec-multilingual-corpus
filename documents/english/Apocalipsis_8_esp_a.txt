When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels standing before God, and they were given seven trumpets.
Another angel came and stood before the altar with a golden censer, and much incense was given to him to add to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
And from the angel's hand the smoke of the incense rose with God with the prayers of the saints.
And the angel took the censer, filled it with the fire from the altar and threw it to the ground, and there was thunder, noise, lightning, and an earthquake.
Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
The first blew the trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood came, and they were thrown to the ground; and a third of the earth was burned, a third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was burned.
The second angel blew the trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea turned to blood.
And a third of the beings that were in the sea and that had life died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.
The third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on the third part of the rivers and on the springs of the waters.
And the name of the star is Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died because of the waters, because they had become bitter.
The fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third part of the sun, the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were wounded, so that the third part of them was darkened and the day did not shine in its third part, and likewise at night.
Then I looked and heard an eagle fly in the middle of the sky, saying with a loud voice: Woe, woe, woe, from those who live on earth, because of the missing trumpet blasts, that the other three angels they are to touch!
