Brothers, even if someone is caught in a fault, you who are spiritual, restore it in a spirit of meekness, looking at yourself, lest you too be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
Because if someone believes that he is something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have reason to glory only with respect to himself, and not with respect to another.
Because each one will carry his own load.
And to the one who is taught the word, let him share every good thing with the one who teaches him.
Do not be fooled, nobody mocks God; for whatever a man sows, that will also reap.
For he who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but he who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
And let us not tire of doing good, because in time, if we do not tire, we will reap.
So then, let us do good to all as we have opportunity, and especially to those of the family of faith.
Look at what big letters I write to you with my own hand.
Those who desire to please in the flesh try to force you to be circumcised, simply so as not to be persecuted because of the cross of Christ.
For even the very ones who are circumcised do not keep the law, but they want to make you circumcise to glory in your flesh.
But it never happens that I glory, but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified for me and I for the world.
Because neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
And to those who walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God.
From now on no one bothers me, because I carry the marks of Jesus on my body.
Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
