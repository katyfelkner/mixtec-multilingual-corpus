Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and everyone who loves the Father loves the one who is born of Him.
In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments.
For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome.
Because everything that is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith.
And who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not only with water, but with water and blood. And the Spirit is the one that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
For there are three who bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. And there are three who bear witness on earth:
the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three agree.
If we receive the testimony of men, the greater is the testimony of God; because this is the testimony of God: that He has given testimony about his Son.
He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; He who does not believe God has made God a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given regarding his Son.
And the testimony is this: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
He who has the Son has life, and he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
And this is the confidence we have before Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have made to Him.
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he will ask, and through him God will give life to those who commit sin that does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death; I'm not saying you should ask for that one.
All injustice is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.
We know that everyone who is born of God does not sin; but he who was born of God keeps it and the evil one does not touch it.
We know that we are from God, and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one.
And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true one; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
Children, beware of idols.
