In those days John the Baptist appeared preaching in the Judean desert
and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"
For this is the one of whom it was said through the prophet Isaiah: Voice of the one who proclaims in the desert: "Prepare the way of the Lord; straighten your paths."
Juan himself was dressed in camel hair and with a leather belt around his waist. Their food was lobsters and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the Jordan region went out to him
and, confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
But when John saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to their baptism, he said to them: "Generation of vipers! Who taught you to flee from the wrath to come?
So bear fruit worthy of repentance;
and do not think to say within you: 'We have Abraham as father'. Because I tell you that even from these stones God can raise children to Abraham.
The ax is already at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I, indeed, baptize you in water for repentance; but he who comes after me, whose shoes I am not worth wearing, is more powerful than me. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.
Your fan is in your hand, and it will cleanse your era. He will gather his wheat in the barn and burn the straw in the fire that will never go out. "
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
But Juan tried to stop him saying: â€”I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?
But Jesus answered him: "Allow it for now, because in this way it is convenient for us to fulfill all justice." Then he allowed it.
And when Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up out of the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.
And behold, a voice from heaven said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
