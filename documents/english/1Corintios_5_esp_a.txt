Indeed, it is heard that there is immorality among you, and an immorality such as does not exist even among the Gentiles, to the extent that someone has his father's wife.
And you have become arrogant instead of being saddened, so that the one among you who has committed this action might be cast out from among you.
For I, for my part, although absent in body but present in spirit, as if I were present, have already judged the one who committed such an action.
In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are gathered together, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
Deliver this fellow to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole dough?
Clean the old yeast so that you are new dough, just as you are, without yeast. Because even Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed.
Therefore, let us celebrate the feast not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
In my letter I wrote you not to go in the company of immoral people;
I was not talking about the immoral people of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or the idolaters, because then you would have to leave the world.
Rather, in fact, I wrote you not to be in the company of anyone who, calling himself a brother, is an immoral person, or miser, or idolater, or defamer, or drunkard, or swindler; with that, don't even eat.
Well, why should I judge outsiders? Do you not judge those within the church?
But God judges those who are outside. Expel the wicked from among you.
