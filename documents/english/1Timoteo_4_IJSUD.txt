But the Spirit clearly says that in recent times some will apostatize from the faith, listening to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons;
that with hypocrisy they will speak lies, having their conscience seared.
That they will forbid to marry and they will order to abstain from foods that God created so that with thanksgiving the believers and those who have known the truth participate in them.
Because everything God created is good, and nothing should be thrown away, if it is received with thanksgiving,
because by the word of God and by prayer he is sanctified.
If you teach this to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished with the words of faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed.
Throw away the profane and old fables, and exercise yourself for godliness.
Because bodily exercise is profitable for little, but piety takes advantage of everything, since it has promise of this present and future life.
This is a faithful word, and worthy of being received by all.
That for this very reason we work and suffer shame, because we hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially those who believe.
This commands and teaches.
Let no one hold your youth in vain, but be an example to the believers in word, conduct, love, spirit, faith and purity.
Meanwhile I go, occupy yourself in reading, in exhorting, in teaching.
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the council of elders.
Meditate on these things; engage in them, so that your progress is manifest to all.
Be careful of yourself and of the doctrine; persist in it, because by doing this, you will save yourself and those who hear you.
