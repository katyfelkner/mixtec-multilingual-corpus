Although many rings God gave me
not a finger touched me
So in the belly I bring them!
Earthworm or worm.
Let's see if you give! They call me a thief, that's my costume:
Since baby I have gray hair and a great mask
The raccoon
Guessed? He donated fire to humanity.
The tail is bare. He always walks with tlachique, or other stolen food.
In the face of danger, the dead body stinks or flies.
The raccoon.
Will you guess It is loading the planet. One more clue goes to you: its skin has furrows of cornfield, although you will not touch it.
One last clue, and nothing more: the slime doesn't fall for anything ... will you guess?
The crocodile.
What animal since childhood has wrinkles on its neck?
The buzzard.
Guess riddle. Daily, with the house in tow rests.
The snail.
I'm always in the gossip. My green suit is stunning, with a tall hat and an elegant toupee.
The cotorro.
Neither hand nor tool do I want. I drill trees, and I'm not a carpenter man. More in the tree ...
The woodpecker.
Guess what! He knows how to sing, although he cannot read or count. In the end, it will always wake you up.
The rooster.
You already know who I am? Little boy of a thousand colors, I go to the place of the clouds. I delight in the sweetness of a thousand flowers with its flavors.
The hummingbird.
I tell you once: in his dance he winds his everlasting riddle. Dirty clothes change in their journey. I tell you again: everlasting riddle meanders in its dance. Dirty clothes change in their journey.
The snake.
Because it shines with a tinkling intensity, at home, neither candle, nor light, nor electricity.
The Firefly.
Let's see if you know who he is! He crawls like babies when he is old. As a young man he stands on two feet.
The man.
