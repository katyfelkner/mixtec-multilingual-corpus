So as we couldn't take it anymore, it felt good to be left alone in Athens,
and we sent Timothy, our brother [a] and collaborator of God in the gospel of Christ, to affirm and encourage them in their faith;
so that no one is disturbed in the midst of these tribulations because you yourselves know that we have been set for this.
Because when we were still with you we predicted that we would suffer tribulations. And so it has happened, as you well know.
For this reason, since I could not bear it any longer, I sent him to inform me of your faith, lest the tempter tempted you and our great effort was in vain.
But now Timothy has returned from you to us and has given us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good memories of us, wanting to see us, just as we also have you.
That is why we have been encouraged by you, brothers, through your faith, in all our need and affliction.
Because now we live, if indeed they are firm in the Lord.
Therefore, what thanksgiving can we give to God with respect to you as a reward for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God?
By day and by night we plead earnestly, to see them personally and fill in what is lacking in their faith.
May God himself and our Father, with our Lord Jesus, open the way for you!
The Lord multiply you and make you abound in love for each other and for all, just as we do for you;
in order to confirm your blameless heart in holiness before God our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints [b].
