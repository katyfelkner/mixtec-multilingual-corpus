Then he began to speak to them in parables: A man PLANTED A VINEYARD AND FENCED IT WITH A WALL, DIGGED A POND UNDER THE WINERY AND BUILT A TOWER; he leased it to farmers and went on a trip.
At the time of the harvest he sent a servant to the farmers to receive from the farmers their share of the fruits of the vineyard.
But they, seizing him, beat him and sent him empty-handed.
Again another servant sent them, and they struck him in the head and treated him shamefully.
And he sent another and they killed him; and so with many others, beating some and killing others.
He still had one left, a beloved son; And he sent the latter, saying, "They will respect my son."
But those farmers said to each other: "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!"
And seizing him, they killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and he will give the vineyard to others.
Have you not even read this Scripture: "THE STONE THAT THE BUILDERS DROPPED, THAT ONE, HAS BECOME A CORNER STONE;
THIS WAS DONE FROM THE LORD, AND IS IT WONDERFUL TO OUR EYES "?
And they tried to catch him, but they feared the crowd, because they understood that he had told the parable against them. And leaving him, they left.
And they sent him * some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to surprise him in a word.
And when they arrived *, they said to him: "Master, we know that you are truthful and that you do not seek the favor of anyone, because you are impartial, and you teach the way of God with truth. Is it legal to pay tax to Caesar, or not?
Will we pay or not pay? But He, realizing their hypocrisy, said to them: Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius to see it.
They brought it to him, and He * said to them: Whose is this image and the inscription? And they said to him: Of Caesar.
Then Jesus said to them, Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's. And they marveled at Him.
And some Sadducees (those who say there is no resurrection) approached him *, and asked him, saying:
Master, Moses left us written: IF THE BROTHER OF SOMEONE DIES and leaves a woman AND DOES NOT LEAVE A SON, THAT HIS BROTHER TAKE THE WOMAN AND RAISE DESCENT TO HIS BROTHER.
There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no offspring.
And the second took it, and died without leaving offspring; and also the third;
and so the seven, without leaving offspring. And finally the woman also died.
In the resurrection, when they are resurrected, whose wife will they be? Well, the seven had her as a wife.
Jesus said to them: Is this not the reason why you are mistaken: that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God?
For when they rise from the dead, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the angels in heaven.
And as for the dead rising, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage on the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying: "I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GODS OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD FROM JACOB "?
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are very wrong.
When one of the scribes approached, he heard them arguing, and recognizing that he had answered them well, he asked him: Which commandment is the most important of all?
Jesus replied: The most important is: "LISTEN, ISRAEL; THE LORD OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE;
AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH. "
The second is this: "YOU WILL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF". There is no other commandment greater than these.
And the scribe said to him: Very well, Master; with truth you have said that HE IS ONE, AND THERE IS NO OTHER THAN HIM;
AND THAT TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL FORCES, AND LOVING YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF, is more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.
When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said: You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that, no one ventured to ask him any more questions.
And taking the word, Jesus said while teaching in the temple: Why do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
David himself said by the Holy Spirit: "THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD:" SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES UNDER YOUR FEET. "
David himself calls him "Lord". In what sense, then, is your son? And the great crowd listened to him with pleasure.
And in his teaching he said: Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love respectful greetings in the squares,
the first seats in synagogues and places of honor at banquets;
who devour widows' houses, and for appearances make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.
Jesus sat in front of the treasure chest, and watched the crowd pour money into the treasure chest; and many rich people threw large amounts.
And a poor widow came and threw two small copper coins, that is, a quadrant.
And calling his disciples, he said to them: Truly I say to you, that this poor widow threw more than all the taxpayers into the treasury;
Because they all threw out what they had left, but she threw out of her poverty everything she owned, everything she had to live on.
