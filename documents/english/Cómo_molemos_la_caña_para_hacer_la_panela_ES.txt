How to Grind the Cane to Make the Panela
I want to tell you how panela is made here in San Juan.
First we cut the cane and take it to the house.
There we put it on the floor of the mill, and then we tie the heads of the bulls so they can start grinding the cane.
When the juice begins to come out of the cane, we put it in a tub.
So we make a fire and boil it for five hours.
Then, when it is already roasted, we take it out.
That molasses hardens. We put it in a saucepan and stir it so that it turns into brown sugar.
We put that molasses in the molds and leave it to become panela.
The panela is used to sweeten the coffee we drink, for the atole or for anything we want to put it on, such as sweets, pumpkin, or anything else we want.
This is the work we do here.
