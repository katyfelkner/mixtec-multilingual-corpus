Tale of the Deer and the Turtle
One day the turtle found the deer and said:
"Friend, you are very fast,
But I would like us to have a competition to see if I can reach you.
The deer replied:
"And you, when would you reach me?"
But if you want to compete with me, that's fine.
—We will meet tomorrow where the ceiba is
Said the turtle.
So the turtle went to look for all the other turtles there were, he gathered them and said:
—Tomorrow I am going to compete in a race with the deer and they will see how we will win. I say we will win, because you will help me.
You will be all the way, a little withdrawn from each other, until you reach the goal. When they see the deer approaching, they will hit the road and scream; "I'm already here!"
So will each one of you.
The next day the turtle and the deer met on the ceiba tree, and the deer said:
"What, are you ready?"
"I'm ready," said the turtle.
And the race began. But the turtle that began to run with the deer no longer ran, but stayed, and another was the one that followed; and so they obeyed the instructions given by the turtle that was going to compete with the deer.
One by one the turtles came out onto the road when they saw the deer approach. And they shouted at him: "I'm here!" When it was not long before the deer reached a stream, a turtle shouted: "I'm here!"
Then the deer became very sad, but he kept running and said, "I'm going to run faster to see if I can catch the turtle." Little had he run when another turtle came out saying, "I'm here!"
But the deer kept running a little more, only later another turtle came out telling him; -I'm already here!
The deer ran out of strength, and he could not take another step and fell. The turtle that had come out, approached where the deer had fallen and said:
"Now yes, friend, I beat you!"
