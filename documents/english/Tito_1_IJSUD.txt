Paul, servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and full knowledge of the truth that is according to godliness,
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised from before the beginning of time,
and in due time he manifested his word through preaching, which was entrusted to me by command of God our Savior,
Titus, true son in common faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
For this reason I left you in Crete, so that you could correct what was missing, and put elders in each city, just as I commanded you:
he who is blameless, the husband of one wife, and who has believing children who are not accused of dissolution or rebellion.
Because it is necessary that the bishop is blameless as God's administrator; not haughty, not angry, not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy for dishonest profit,
but hospitable, lover of the good, prudent, just, holy, master of himself,
Retainer of the faithful word that is according to the teaching, so that he can also exhort with sound doctrine and convince those who contradict.
Because there are still many rebels, talkative of vanities and deceivers, especially those who are of the circumcision,
those who must cover their mouths, because they upset entire houses, teaching what is not due, for dishonest gain.
One of them said, his own prophet: Cretans are always liars, bad beasts, lazy gluttons.
This testimony is true; therefore reprove them harshly so that they may be sound in the faith,
not heeding Jewish fables or commandments of men who depart from the truth.
All things are pure for the pure; but for the corrupted and unbelievers nothing is pure, since even their mind and conscience are corrupted.
They profess to know God, but with facts they deny him, being abominable and rebellious, condemned as regards every good work.
