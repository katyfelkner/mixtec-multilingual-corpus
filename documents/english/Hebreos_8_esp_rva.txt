In short, what we have been saying is this: We have such a high priest that he sat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
minister of the most holy place and of the true tabernacle that the Lord raised up and not man.
Because every high priest is put to offer offerings and sacrifices; hence it was necessary that he also have something to offer.
If I were on earth I would not even be a priest, because there are already priests who offer offerings according to the law.
They serve what is the figure and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses had been warned when he was about to build the tabernacle, saying: See, you will do all things according to the pattern that has been shown to you on the mount [a] .
But now Jesus has reached a priestly ministry all the more excellent in that he is the mediator of a superior covenant, which has been established on superior promises.
Because if the first covenant had been without defect, no place would have been sought for a second.
For, rebuking them, he says, "Behold, the days are coming," says the Lord, "when I will conclude with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;
not like the covenant I made with their parents on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not remain in my covenant, and I stopped worrying about them, "says the Lord.
"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days," says the Lord. "I will put my laws in their minds and inscribe them in their hearts. And I will be God to them, and to me they will be people.
No one will teach his neighbor, nor anyone his brother, saying: 'Know the Lord'; because everyone will know me, from the youngest of them to the oldest.
Because I will be merciful regarding their injustices and I will never remember their sins "[b].
By saying "new", you have declared the first one expired; and what has become old and outdated is about to disappear.
