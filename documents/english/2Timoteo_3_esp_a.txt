But you must know this: that in the last days difficult times will come.
Because men will be lovers of themselves, greedy, boastful, arrogant, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, irreverent,
loveless, ruthless, slanderers, rampant, savage, haters of good,
traitors, impetuous, puffed up, lovers of pleasures instead of lovers of God;
having the appearance of pity, but having denied his power; avoid such.
Because among them are those who get into the houses and take captive little women loaded with sins, carried by various passions,
always learning, but they can never come to full knowledge of the truth.
And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, in the same way they also oppose the truth; men of depraved mind, reprobate as regards faith.
But they will not progress any further, since their folly will be manifest to everyone, as also happened with that of those two.
But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,
persecutions, sufferings, like those that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra. What persecutions I suffered! And from all of them the Lord delivered me.
And in truth, all those who want to live godly in Jesus Christ will be persecuted.
But evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
You, however, persist in the things that you have learned and of which you convinced yourself, knowing from whom you have learned them;
and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which can give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is inspired by God and useful to teach, to rebuke, to correct, to instruct in righteousness,
so that the man of God is perfect, equipped for every good work.
