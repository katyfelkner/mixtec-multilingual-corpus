How are advisory or defense services requested?
The applicant must go to one of the offices of the Ombudsman, located in Mexico City, Xalapa and Oaxaca, or you can contact us by phone, email or fax.
In these last three cases (telephone, email or fax) the request will be forwarded for prompt attention to an advocate, who will be responsible for giving due attention to the applicant.
In the indicated offices, the citizen will be attended by an ombudsman, who will fill out an application form with their general information and the reason why they require the services of the Ombudsman.
In order to maximize effective judicial protection, this manual makes the indigenous peoples and communities, as well as the general public, aware of the locations and contact details of the Public Defender of this Court, should they require their services.
