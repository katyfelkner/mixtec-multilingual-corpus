What it was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have contemplated and what our hands touched about the Word of life
(because life was manifested, and we have seen it, and we testify and announce to you eternal life, which was with the Father and has been manifested to us);
what we have seen and heard, we announce to you, so that you too may have communion with us; and our fellowship truly is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And these things we write to you, so that your joy may be complete.
And this is the message that we have heard from him and that we announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness.
If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;
but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all evil.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
