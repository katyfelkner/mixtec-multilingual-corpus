TALE OF THE CARPENTER AND THE PICHUACA BIRD
I am going to tell you the story of the pichuaca and the woodpecker.
The woodpecker was a musician and used to go to all parties to play.
But he was sorry because his clothes were a very sad color.
So he said one day to the pichuaca:
"Why don't you lend me your suit to wear?"
Because the color of mine is very sad and I feel sorry, because I'm always going to play at parties.
Please ask me to lend it to me to wear tonight. The suit you are wearing is very beautiful.
Then the pichuaca replied:
"No, I won't lend it to you."
This is the only suit I have. Poor me.
But the carpenter insisted saying:
"Lend me, it's just for one night."
"No, I won't give it to you, because I would be ashamed to be naked," said the pichuaca.
"Don't worry about it," said the woodpecker.
"I lend you my suit and you put it on."
It's only for tonight.
"Well, man," said the pichuaca at last.
So he lent his suit to the carpenter and she put on the carpenter's suit, in turn.
Then the pichuaca said:
-!Oh oh!
Your suit is so ugly, and it's also broken.
But the carpenter insisted and said:
"Only tonight I want to wear your suit and I'll return it to you tomorrow."
I'm leaving now, because it's time to go to the dance.
I am in charge.
I touch the box, ‚Äùsaid the woodpecker.
So the carpenter left and the pichuaca stayed there that night.
The next day the pichuaca was waiting for the woodpecker to return.
He waited a long time, but the carpenter did not appear.
Then the pichuaca started crying loudly, because she was hungry and could not go looking for her food because the suit she was wearing was torn and she was sorry that they saw her like that.
So he stayed right there and cried all night, because the carpenter never came back with his suit.
This is how the story ends.
