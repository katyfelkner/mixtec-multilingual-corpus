For the rest, brothers, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread quickly and be glorified, as it also happened among you;
and that we be delivered from evil and wicked men; because faith is not everyone's.
But faithful is the Lord, who will establish them and keep them from evil.
We have confidence in the Lord regarding you, who do and will do what we command you.
May the Lord direct your heart to the love of God and the patience of Christ!
However, we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to separate yourselves from any brother who walks disorderly and not according to the doctrine they received [from] us.
You yourselves know how you should imitate us, because we have not lived disorderly among you
nor have we eaten anyone's bread for nothing. Rather, we work hard to exhaustion, night and day, so as not to be burdensome to any of you;
not because we did not have authority but to give them in our people an example to imitate.
Even when we were with you, we admonished you like this: if someone doesn't want to work, don't eat either.
Because we have heard that some walk disorderly among you, working on nothing but meddling in what is foreign.
Such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly eat their own bread.
And you, brothers, do not tire of doing good.
If anyone does not obey our word by letter, point that out and have no dealings with him, to make him ashamed.
But do not regard him as an enemy but admonish him as a brother.
And the Lord of peace himself always give you peace in every way. The Lord be with you all.
This greeting is from my hand, Pablo. This is my signature on all my letters, as I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all [b].
