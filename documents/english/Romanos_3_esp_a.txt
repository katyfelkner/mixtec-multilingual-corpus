What, then, is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
Great in every way. First, because they have been entrusted with the oracles of God.
So what? If some were unfaithful, will their unfaithfulness nullify God's faithfulness?
No way! Rather, may God be found truthful, even though every man may be found a liar; as it is written: SO THAT YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND YOU COME WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED.
And if our injustice highlights God's justice, what will we say? Is the God who expresses his wrath unfair? (I speak in human terms).
No way! For otherwise, how would God judge the world?
But if by my lie the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
And why not say (as we are slandered, and as some claim that we say): Let us do evil so that good may come? The condemnation of such is just.
So what? Are we better than them? No way; because we have already denounced that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
as it is written: THERE IS NO FAIR, NOT EVEN ONE;
THERE IS NO ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NO ONE WHO SEEKS GOD;
ALL HAVE DIVERTED, TO ONE BECAME USELESS; THERE IS NO ONE WHO DOES THE GOOD THING, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.
OPPOSED SEPULCRO IS THEIR THROAT, THEY DECEIVE CONTINUOUSLY WITH THEIR TONGUE, POISON OF SNAKES THERE IS UNDER THEIR LIPS;
FULL IS HIS MOUTH OF CURSE AND BITTER;
THEIR FEET ARE SPEED TO SPILL BLOOD;
DESTRUCTION AND MISERY there is ON THEIR ROADS,
AND THE PATH OF PEACE HAVE NOT BEEN KNOWN.
THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES.
Now, we know that what the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth is silent and everyone is held accountable before God;
for by the works of the law no human being will be justified before Him; for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
But now, apart from the law, the justice of God has been manifested, witnessed by the law and the prophets;
that is, the justice of God through faith in Jesus Christ, for all who believe; because there is no distinction;
because everyone sinned and did not reach the glory of God,
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
whom God publicly exhibited as a propitiation for his blood through faith, as a demonstration of his justice, because in his tolerance, God overlooked the sins previously committed,
to demonstrate his righteousness at this time, so that He may be just and justify the one who has faith in Jesus.
Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? The one with the works? No, but by the law of faith.
Because we conclude that man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,
because in truth God is one, who will justify by virtue of faith the circumcised and through faith the uncircumcised.
Do we then nullify the law through faith? No way! On the contrary, we confirm the law.
