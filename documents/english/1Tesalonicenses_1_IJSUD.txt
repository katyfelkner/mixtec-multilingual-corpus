Paul, Silvano and Timoteo, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We always thank God for all of you, remembering you in our prayers,
remembering incessantly before the God and our Father the work of your faith, the work of love and your perseverance in the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ;
knowing, beloved brothers of God, your choice;
for our gospel was not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in great assurance; you well know how we were among you for love of you.
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in the midst of much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
in such a way that you have been an example to all those who have believed in Macedonia and Achaia.
For from you the word of the Lord has resounded, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also everywhere your faith in God has spread, so that we have no need to speak anything.
Because they tell us about the way you received us, and how you turned from idols to God, to serve the living and true God,
and wait for his Son from heaven, the one who rose from the dead, Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.
