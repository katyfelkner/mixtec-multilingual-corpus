After this I heard like a great voice from a great crowd in the sky, saying: Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
for his judgments are true and just, for he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged the blood of her servants upon her.
And they said a second time: Hallelujah! Her smoke rises for ever and ever.
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who is sitting on the throne, and said: Amen! Hallelujah!
And from the throne came a voice that said: Praise our God all his servants, those who fear him, the little ones and the great ones.
And I heard like the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of strong thunder, saying: Hallelujah! Because the Lord our Almighty God reigns.
Let us rejoice and be glad, and let us give Him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.
And it was given to her to dress in fine linen, shining and clean, because the righteous actions of the saints are fine linen.
And the angel said to me *: Write: "Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said to me *: These are true words of God.
Then I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me *: Don't do that; I am a servant to you and to your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
And I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse; the one who mounted it is called Faithful and True, and with justice he judges and makes war.
His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head there are many diadems, and he has a written name that nobody knows but Him.
And he is dressed in a cloak soaked in blood, and his name is: The Word of God.
And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed him on white horses.
A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to strike the nations with it, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fury of the wrath of Almighty God.
And on his cloak and on his thigh he has a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
And I saw an angel standing in the sun. And he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the middle of the sky: Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders and the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and their horsemen, and the flesh of all men, free and slaves, small and great.
Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one on the horse and against his army.
And the beast was caught, and with it the false prophet who made signs in his presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image; the two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
And the rest were slain with the sword that came out of the horse rider's mouth, and all the birds were satisfied with their meat.
