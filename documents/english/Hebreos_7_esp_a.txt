Because this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, went to meet Abraham when he returned from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him.
Abraham gave him the tithe of all the spoils, whose name means first king of justice, and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace,
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having no beginning of days or end of life, being made similar to the Son of God, he remains a priest in perpetuity.
Consider, then, the greatness of this man to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave the tithe of the best of the spoils.
And in truth those of the sons of Levi who receive the office of priest, have a commandment in the law to collect the tithe from the people, that is, from their brothers, although these are descendants of Abraham.
But the one whose genealogy does not come from them received the tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
And without any discussion, the minor is blessed by the older.
Here, certainly mortal men receive tithing, but there, one receives it from whom it is testified that he lives.
And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,
because he was still on his father's back when Melchizedek met him.
Now, if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on that basis the people received the law), what need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not appointed according to the order of Aaron?
Because when the priesthood is changed, a change in the law necessarily also occurs.
For the one about whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, of which no one has served at the altar.
Because it is evident that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe of which Moses did not say anything regarding priests.
And this is even more evident, if in the likeness of Melchizedek another priest rises,
that it has become so, not on the basis of a law of physical requirements, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
For it bears witness: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
Because certainly, the previous commandment is annulled for being weak and useless
(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.
And because it was not without an oath,
for in truth they became priests without an oath, but He by an oath of which said to him: The Lord has sworn and will not change: "You are a priest forever",
therefore, Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant.
The previous priests were more numerous because death prevented them from continuing,
but He preserves his unchangeable priesthood since it remains forever.
Therefore He is also powerful to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He lives perpetually to intercede for them.
Because it was fitting for us to have such a High Priest: holy, innocent, immaculate, set apart from sinners and exalted beyond heaven,
that he does not need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and later for the sins of the people; because he did this once for all, when he offered himself.
Because the law designates weak men as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, designates the Son, made perfect forever.
