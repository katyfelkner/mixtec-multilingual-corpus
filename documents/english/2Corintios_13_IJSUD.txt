This is the third time I have come to you. Through the mouth of two or three witnesses every word will be established.
I have said before, and now I say again as if I were present, and now absent I write it to those who previously sinned, and to all the others, that if I go again, I will not be indulgent,
for you are seeking proof that Christ speaks in me, he who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you.
Because although he was crucified in weakness, he lives by the power of God. For we too are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God towards you.
Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith; test yourselves. Or do you not know yourselves? Do you not know that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless you are failing!
But I hope that you recognize that we are not reprobate.
And we pray to God that you do nothing wrong; not so that we may be found approved, but so that you may do what is good, even though we may be rejected.
Because we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
Therefore we rejoice that we are weak, and that you are strong; and we still pray for your perfection.
Therefore I write this to you while absent, so as not to be severe when I am present, according to the authority that the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction.
For the rest, brothers, have joy, be perfect, have consolation, be of the same mind and live in peace; and the God of peace and charity will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
