And Jesus, six days before Passover, went to Bethany, where Lazarus was, the one who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
And they made him a dinner there; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
Then Mary took a pound of perfume of pure tuberose, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped them with her hair; And the house was filled with the smell of perfume.
And one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot son of Simon, the one who was going to deliver him, said:
Why has this perfume not been sold for three hundred denarii, to give to the poor?
But he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and he had the bag and stole what was put into it.
Then Jesus said: Leave her; He has kept this for the day of my burial.
Because you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
Then many people from the Jews found out that he was there; and they came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
But the chief priests agreed to kill Lazarus as well,
Because because of him, many of the Jews turned away and believed in Jesus.
The next day, many people who had come to the party, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
They took palm branches and came out to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!
And Jesus found a donkey and rode on it, as it is written:
Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes, riding on a donkey's donkey.
These things were not understood by his disciples at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that these things had been done to him.
And the people who were with him testified when he called Lazarus from the grave and raised him from the dead.
Therefore the people had also come out to meet him, because they had heard that he had performed this miracle;
But the Pharisees said to each other: Do you see that you achieve nothing? Behold, the world goes after him.
And there were certain Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast.
These therefore approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we would like to see Jesus.
Felipe went and told Andr√©s. Then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
Then Jesus answered them, saying: The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
Truly, truly, I tell you that if the grain of wheat does not fall on the ground and die, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
He who loves his life will lose it; and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
If anyone serves me, follow me; And where I am, there will also be my server. If anyone serves me, my Father will honor him.
Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say: Father, save me from this hour? But for this I have come to this hour.
Father, glorify your name. Then a voice came from heaven: I have already glorified him, and I will glorify him again.
And the people who were present, and who had heard it, said that it had been thunder. Others said: An angel has spoken to him.
Jesus answered and said: This voice has not come because of me, but because of you.
Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.
And I, if I am lifted from the earth, I will draw all of myself.
And this he said implying what death he was going to die from.
The people answered him: We have heard that, according to the law, the Christ remains forever. How, then, do you say that it is necessary for the Son of Man to be raised up? Who is this Son of Man?
Then Jesus said to them: Even for a little while the light will be among you. Walk while you have light, so that darkness does not surprise you, because he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.
While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light. These things Jesus spoke, and went away and hid himself from them.
But, despite having done so many miracles in front of them, they did not believe in him,
so that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said: Lord, who believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah also said:
He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they do not see with the eyes, nor understand with the heart, and they are converted, and I heal them.
These things said Isaiah when he saw his glory and spoke of him.
With all that, even of the rulers, many believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so as not to be expelled from the synagogue.
Because they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
But Jesus cried out and said: He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me;
and he who sees me sees him who sent me.
I, the light, have come into the world, so that everyone who believes in me does not remain in darkness.
And whoever hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; because I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
He who rejects me and does not receive my words has someone to judge him; the word that I have spoken, she will judge him in the last day.
Because I have not spoken for myself, but the Father who sent me, he has given me a commandment of what to say and what to speak.
And I know that his commandment is eternal life; so what I speak, I speak as the Father has told me.
