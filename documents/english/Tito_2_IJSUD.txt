But you, speak what agrees with sound doctrine.
May the elderly be sober, serious, prudent, healthy in faith, in love, in patience.
The old women, likewise, be reverent in their bearing; not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of the good;
to teach young women to love their husbands and to love their children,
to be prudent, chaste, careful of their house, good, subject to their husbands, so that the word of God is not blasphemed.
He also exhorts young people to be sensible;
present yourself in everything as an example of good works; in teaching, showing integrity, seriousness,
healthy and irreproachable word, so that the adversary is ashamed and has nothing bad to say about you.
He exhorts slaves to be subject to their masters, to like them in everything and not to be responders;
not defrauding, but being faithful in everything, so that they may adorn in all the doctrine of God our Savior.
Because the grace of God that brings salvation to all men has been manifested,
teaching us that, rejecting impiety and worldly desires, we live in this world soberly, justly and piously,
waiting for the blessed hope and the glorious manifestation of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify for himself a people of his own, zealous for good works.
This speaks and exhorts, and rebukes with all authority. No one despises you.
