Do we start again to recommend ourselves? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation for you, or yours?
You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men.
It is evident that you are a letter from Christ, issued by us, written not in ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tablets, but on the tablets of human hearts.
We have this confidence before God, through Christ:
not that we are enough in ourselves to think that something comes from us, but that our sufficiency comes from God.
He himself trained us as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. Because the letter kills, but the Spirit vivifies.
And if the ministry of death, engraved with letters on stones, came with glory - so much so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was to fade away -
How could the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious!
For if the ministry of condemnation was with glory, how much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory!
For what had been glorious is not glorious in comparison with this excellent glory.
For if what vanished was through glory, how much more does that which remains in glory exceed!
So, having such hope, we act with great confidence;
not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel would not notice the end of what was fading.
However, their minds were hardened; for even today, when they read the old covenant, the same veil is still on, because only in Christ is it removed.
Even to this day, every time they read Moses, the veil is placed over their hearts.
But when they convert to the Lord, the veil will be removed.
Because the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
Therefore, all of us, looking at the naked face as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are transformed from glory to glory in the same image, as by the Spirit of the Lord.
