And I looked, and behold, the Lamb was on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand who had the name of their Father written on their foreheads.
And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of great thunder; I also heard a voice of harpists playing their harps.
And they sang like a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except those one hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from among the earth.
These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, because they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
And no deception was found in their mouths, for they are undefiled before the throne of God.
And I saw another angel fly through the midst of heaven, who had the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
saying with a loud voice: Fear God, and give glory to him, because the hour of his judgment has arrived; and worship him who has made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters.
And another angel followed him, saying: Babylon, that great city, has fallen, because she has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication.
And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives the mark on his forehead or in his hand,
he will also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which has been poured pure into the cup of his wrath; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.
And the smoke from their torment rises forever and ever. Those who worship the beast and its image have no rest day or night, nor does anyone who receives the mark of his name.
Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me: Write: Blessed are the dead who henceforth die in the Lord. Yes, says the Spirit, they will rest from their works, because their works with them continue.
And I looked, and behold a white cloud; and sitting on the cloud, one like the Son of Man, who had a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.
And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud: Put your sickle in it, and reap, because the harvest time has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
And he who sat on the cloud passed his sickle on the earth, and the earth was mowed.
And another angel came out of the temple that is in heaven, also having a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over the fire, and cried out with a loud voice to the one with the sharp sickle, saying: Put in your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters of the earth, because their grapes are ripe!
And the angel passed his sharp sickle on the earth, and harvested the vineyard of the earth and threw the grapes in the great winepress of the wrath of God.
And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress that reached the horses' bridles throughout sixteen hundred stadia.
