Therefore, holy brothers, participants in the heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our faith.
Who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as was Moses in all the house of God.
Because He has been considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
For every house is made by someone, but the one who does all things is God.
And Moses was faithful in all the house of God like servant, for testimony of what was going to be said later;
but Christ was faithful as Son over the house of God, whose house we are, if we hold firm to the end our confidence and the glory of our hope.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: If you hear his voice today,
do not harden your hearts, as in provocation, as in the day of trial in the desert,
where your parents tempted me by testing me, and they saw my works for forty years.
For this reason I was displeased with that generation, and said: "they always stray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways";
as I swore in my anger, "They will not enter into my rest."
Be careful, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to turn away from the living God.
Before exhort each other every day, while still saying: Today; lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
Because we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold firm to the end the principle of our security,
as soon as it is said: If you hear his voice today, do not harden your hearts, as in provocation.
For who, having heard, provoked him? Were not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?
And who were you upset with for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
So we see that they could not enter because of their unbelief.
