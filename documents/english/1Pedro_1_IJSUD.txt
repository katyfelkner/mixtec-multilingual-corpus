Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to the pilgrims scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctification of the Spirit, to obey and be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied to you.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has made us be born again to a living hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
for an incorruptible, uncontaminated and unfading heritage, reserved in heaven for you,
that you are kept by the power of God, through faith, to reach the salvation that is prepared to be manifested in the last time.
In which you rejoice, although, if necessary, for a little while you have to be afflicted with various temptations,
so that the test of your faith, much more precious than gold, which perishes even if it is tested by fire, is found worthy of praise, glory and honor, when Jesus Christ is manifested;
whom, although you have not seen, you love; in whom believing, although at present you do not see it, you rejoice with ineffable and glorified joy,
obtaining the end of your faith, which is the salvation of your souls.
About this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to come to you inquired and diligently inquired,
scrutinizing what conditions or what time indicated the Spirit of Christ that was in them, the one that predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow after these.
To whom it was revealed that they were ministering, not to themselves, but to us, the same things that have now been announced to you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; things that angels long to look at.
Therefore, having girded the loins of your understanding, being sober, have full hope in the grace that will be presented to you when Jesus Christ is revealed to you.
As obedient children, do not conform to the wishes that you previously had being in your ignorance,
but as he who called you is holy, be ye also holy in all your conduct,
for it is written, Be holy, for I am holy.
And if you invoke as Father the one who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, conduct yourselves in fear all the time of your pilgrimage,
knowing that you have been rescued from your vain conduct, which you received by tradition from your parents, not with corruptible things, such as gold or silver,
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without spot and without contamination,
already ordained since before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the last times for love of you,
that through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and has given him glory, so that your faith and hope may be in God.
Having purified your souls through obedience to the truth, through the Spirit, until you reach an unfeigned brotherly love, love each other dearly with a pure heart,
having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of an incorruptible one, by the word of God that lives and remains forever.
For: All flesh is like grass, and all the glory of man like the flower of grass: The grass dries up, and the flower falls;
