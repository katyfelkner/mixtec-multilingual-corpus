If I spoke human and angelic languages, and I have no charity, I become like a metal that resounds or a cymbal that rattles.
And if I had prophecy, and understood all the mysteries and all knowledge, and if I had all the faith, in such a way that I moved the mountains, and I have no charity, I am nothing.
And if I distributed all my goods to feed the poor, and if I gave my body to be burned, and I have no charity, it is useless to me.
Charity is suffered, it is benign; charity is not envious, charity does not boast, it is not puffed up;
he does not behave improperly, he does not seek his own, he is not irritated, he does not think evil;
he does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices in the truth;
he suffers everything, he believes everything, he hopes for everything, he endures everything.
Charity never ceases to be; but the prophecies will end, and the tongues will cease, and the knowledge will end;
because in part we know, and in part we prophesy;
but when what is perfect comes, then what is in part will end.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I judged as a child; but when I was a man, I left what was a boy.
Now we see through the mirror, darkly; but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part; but then I will know how I was known.
And now faith, hope and charity remain, these three; but the greatest of them is charity.
