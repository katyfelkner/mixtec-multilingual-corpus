And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud; and the rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like columns of fire;
and he had in his hand an open little book. And he put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land;
and he cried out with a loud voice, as a lion roars; and when he screamed, the seven thunders emitted their voices.
After the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, when I heard a voice from heaven saying: Seal the things that the seven thunders have said and do not write them.
Then the angel that I had seen standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven,
and he swore by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that no longer there will be procrastination,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is ready to blow the trumpet, then the mystery of God will be consummated, as He announced it to his servants the prophets.
And the voice that I had heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying: Go, take the book that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.
So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. And he said to me *: Take it and eat it up; It will make your insides bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.
I took the little book from the angel's hand and devoured it, and it was sweet in my mouth like honey; And when I ate it, it made my insides bitter.
And they said to me *: You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.
