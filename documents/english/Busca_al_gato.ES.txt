Find the cat
A man who weaves cloth has a striped cat.
The cat peeked out and saw that it was very pretty,
and thought about going out to see what was in all the town.
The cat went out and left.
He looked for a higher place to see the whole town.
Find the cat.
He came to a factory where things are produced.
Find the cat.
Then he also went to a place where fruit is sold.
Then he went out and left.
Suddenly I was where some musicians were drinking.
After listening to the songs, he left and left. He entered a field where a man was cutting grass.
He left the field
and entered a school among the people who were studying.
He left school
and went to a place where they were fishing,
and he was greatly admired of them.
When you finish looking at the fish,
He went to where there was a donkey and many pitchers.
It got dark
and the cat was still among the people.
And the next day I was at the top of a fruit tree.
Came down from the tree
and he left
He came to a place where they sold cloth.
I walked a lot
and came to a place where a person was weaving a tenate.
Then he got to where some women were working.
When he finished touring the town, he returned home.
