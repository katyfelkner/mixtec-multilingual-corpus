Let every person submit to the governing authorities; because there is no authority but of God, and those that exist, by God are constituted.
Therefore, he who resists authority, has been opposed to what God has ordained; and those who have opposed themselves will receive condemnation.
For the rulers are not a cause of fear for those of good conduct, but for him who does evil. Do you wish, then, not to fear authority? Do good and you will have praise from her,
for he is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do wrong, fear; for it is not in vain that he carries the sword, for he is a minister of God, an avenger who punishes those who practice evil.
Therefore, it is necessary to submit, not only because of punishment, but also because of conscience.
Well, for this you also pay taxes, because the rulers are servants of God, dedicated precisely to this.
Pay everyone what you owe: the one who imposed, imposed; to whom tribute, tribute; to whom fear, fear; to which honor, honor.
You owe nothing to anyone but to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has kept the law.
Because this: You will not commit adultery, you will not kill, you will not steal, you will not covet, and any other commandment, in these words is summed up: You will love your neighbor as yourself.
Love does no harm to neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
And do all this, knowing the time, that it is time to wake up from sleep; because now salvation is closer to us than when we believed.
The night is well advanced, and the day is near. Therefore, let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the weapons of light.
Let us walk decently, as in daylight, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lusts, not in lawsuits and envies;
Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think of providing for the lusts of the flesh.
