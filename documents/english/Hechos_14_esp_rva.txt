It happened in Iconium that they entered the synagogue of the Jews together and spoke in such a way that a large number believed, both Jews and Greeks.
But the Jews who did not believe incited and predisposed the spirit of the Gentiles against the brothers.
With all that, they continued speaking bravely for a long time, trusting in the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.
The people of the city were divided: some were with the Jews, others with the apostles.
As an attempt arose on the part of the Gentiles and the Jews, together with their rulers, to affront and stone them,
they found out and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and throughout the surrounding region.
And there they announced the gospel.
In Lystra a certain man was sitting, handicapped, lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.
He heard Paul speak, who looked at him and saw that he had faith to be healed.
And he said with a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet!" And he jumped and walked.
Then, when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices saying in the Lyonic language: "The gods have descended on us in the form of men!"
Barnabas was called Zeus and Paul Hermes because he was the one who spoke.
Then the priest of the temple of Zeus, which was at the entrance of the city, brought bulls and garlands in front of the city gates, and together with the people wanted to offer them sacrifices.
When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and threw themselves into the crowd crying out
and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things?" We are also men of the same nature as you, and we announce the gospel to you so that you may convert from these vanities to the living God who made heaven, earth, sea, and everything in them.
In past generations God allowed all nations to walk in their own ways;
although he never ceased to bear witness to himself by doing good, giving them showers from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with sustenance and joy.
Even saying these things, they barely managed to prevent the people from offering them sacrifices.
Then from Antioch and Iconium some Jews came, and having persuaded the crowd, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
But the disciples surrounded him, and he got up and entered the city. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.
After announcing the gospel and making many disciples in that city, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
strengthening the spirits of the disciples and exhorting them to persevere faithful in the faith. They said to them: "It is necessary that through many tribulations we enter the kingdom of God."
And after having appointed elders for them in each church and having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they believed.
After crossing Pisidia, they arrived at Pamphylia;
and after preaching the word in Perge, they went down to Attalia.
From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had completed.
After arriving and gathering the church, they began to tell them how many things God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
And they stayed there for a long time with the disciples.
