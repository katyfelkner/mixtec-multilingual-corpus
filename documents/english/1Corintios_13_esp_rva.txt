If I speak in the languages ​​of men and angels but I have no love, I come to be like bronze that resounds or a cymbal that rattles.
If I have prophecy and I understand all the mysteries and all knowledge; And if I have all the faith, in such a way that I move the mountains, but I have no love, I am nothing.
If I distribute all my goods, and if I give my body to be burned, but I have no love, it is useless to me.
Love has patience and is kind. Love is not jealous. Love is not flashy, and is not arrogant.
It is not unseemly, nor does it seek its own. He is not irritated, nor does he keep accounts of evil.
He does not rejoice in injustice, but rejoices in the truth.
He suffers everything, he believes everything, he hopes for everything, he endures everything.
Love never stops being. But the prophecies will end, tongues will cease and knowledge will end.
Because we only know in part and we prophesy in part;
but when what is perfect comes, then what is in part will be abolished.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I gave up what was a boy.
Now we see darkly through a mirror, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I was known.
And now faith, hope and love remain, these three; But the greatest of these is love.
