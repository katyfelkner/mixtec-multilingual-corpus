The Milpa
If you want to plant a cornfield, you must first fallow the land well. In red soil once fallow is sufficient, but in black soil should be fallow twice.
So, when the first rain comes, we start planting the seed and then we till again to cultivate, and then we pluck all the weeds that don't work, and the cornfield will be fine.
When it rains a lot, the harvest is lost, but if it rains just enough, then the harvest is good.
In good soil, which has been prepared with manure, it doesn't matter if it rains a lot or if it rains little, the harvest always goes well.
