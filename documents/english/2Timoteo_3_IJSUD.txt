This you must also know: that dangerous times will come in the last days.
Because there will be men who are loving themselves, greedy, boastful, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, wicked,
without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, cruel, haters of good,
traitors, impetuous, puffed up, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,
having the appearance of pity, but denying the efficacy of it; avoid these.
For of these are they who go into the houses, and take captive the little women laden with sins, carried by various lusts;
they are always learning, but can never come to the knowledge of the truth.
And as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth; corrupt men of understanding, reprobate about faith.
But they will not go far, because their folly will be evident to all, as was theirs as well.
But you have faithfully followed my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,
persecutions, afflictions like those that came over me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; Persecutions that I have suffered, but the Lord has delivered me from all.
And also all those who want to live godly in Jesus Christ will suffer persecution.
But bad men and deceivers will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
But you persist in what you have learned and persuaded yourself, knowing from whom you have learned;
and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which can make you wise for salvation by faith that is in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is inspired by God and useful to teach, to rebuke, to correct, to instruct in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfect, fully instructed in every good work.
