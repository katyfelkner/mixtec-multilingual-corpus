Because it is beside the point to write to you about this service to the saints;
for I know your good disposition, of which I glory for you before the Macedonians, that is, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stimulated most of them.
But I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you is not made in vain in this case, so that, as I said, you are prepared;
lest some Macedonians go with me and find you unprepared, and we (if not you) be ashamed of this trust.
So I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers to come forward to come to you, and prepare in advance your generous offering, already promised, so that it would be ready as a generous offering, and not as greed.
But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and he who sows abundantly will also reap abundantly.
Let each one give as he proposed in his heart, not reluctantly or by obligation, because God loves the joyful giver.
And God can make all grace abound to you, so that having always enough in all things, you abound for every good work;
as it is written: He scattered, gave to the poor; his justice remains forever.
And he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for his food will supply and multiply your sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness;
you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us produces thanksgiving to God.
Because the ministry of this service not only fully supplies what is lacking to the saints, but also abounds through many thanksgivings to God.
By the test given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution for them and for all;
while they too, through prayer on your behalf, demonstrate their longing for you because of the superabundant grace of God in you.
Thank God for his unspeakable gift!
