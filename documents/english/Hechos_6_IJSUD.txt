In those days, as the number of the disciples grew, there was murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews that their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.
So the twelve called together the multitude of the disciples and said: It is not fair that we leave the word of God to serve the tables.
Look, then, brothers, among you seven men of good testimony, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, to whom we entrust this task.
And we will persist in prayer and in the ministry of the word.
And the proposal pleased the whole crowd; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Procorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas and Nicholas, proselyte of Antioch.
They presented them to the apostles, who, after having prayed, laid their hands on them.
And the word of the Lord grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; Many of the priests also obeyed the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and miracles among the people.
Then some of the synagogue of the freedmen, and the Cyrenians, and the Alexandrians, and those of Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.
But they could not resist the wisdom or the Spirit with which he spoke.
Then they bribed some to say that they had heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
And they stirred the people, and the elders, and the scribes; and lashing out, they took him away and brought him to the council.
And they put false witnesses who said: This man does not stop speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and against the law;
Because we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the traditions that Moses gave us.
Then all who were sitting on the council, fixing their eyes on him, saw his face as the face of an angel.
