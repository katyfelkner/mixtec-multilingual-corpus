Seek to attain love; but also ardently desire spiritual gifts, especially that you prophesy.
For he who speaks in tongues speaks not to men, but to God, for no one understands him, but in his spirit speaks mysteries.
But he who prophesies speaks to men for edification, exhortation, and consolation.
He who speaks in tongues builds himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.
I would like you all to speak in tongues, but even more, to prophesy; for he who prophesies is superior to him who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets them so that the church may receive edification.
Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, of what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you by means of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophecy, or of teaching?
Even inanimate things, like the flute or the harp, when producing a sound, if they do not give sounds with distinction, how will you know what is played on the flute or harp?
Because if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle?
So you too, unless you utter intelligible words with your mouth, how will you know what you say? Well, you will talk on air.
There are, perhaps, many varieties of languages ​​in the world, and none are without meaning.
For if I do not know the meaning of the words, I will be a speaker to a stranger, and a speaker will be a stranger to me.
So also you, since you long for spiritual gifts, try to abound in them for the edification of the church.
Therefore, he who speaks in tongues, pray in prayer that he may interpret.
Because if I pray in tongues, my spirit prays, but my understanding remains without fruit.
So what? I will pray with the spirit, but I will also pray with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will also sing with the understanding.
Otherwise, if you bless only in the spirit, how will the Amen say to your thanksgiving the one who occupies the place of the one who does not have that gift, since he does not know what you say?
Because you give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you;
however, in the church I prefer to speak five words with my understanding, to instruct others as well, rather than ten thousand words in tongues.
Brothers, do not be children in the way of thinking; rather, be children in malice, but in the way of thinking be mature.
In the law it is written: By men with strange tongues and by the mouth of strangers I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.
So tongues are a sign, not for those who believe, but for unbelievers; but prophecy is a sign, not for unbelievers, but for believers.
Therefore, if the whole church gathers and everyone speaks in tongues, and some enter without that gift or are unbelievers, won't they say that you are crazy?
But if everyone prophesies, and an unbeliever enters, or one without that gift, he will be convinced by all, he will be judged by all;
the secrets of his heart will be revealed, and he will fall down and adore God, declaring that God is truly among you.
What, then, must be done, brothers? When you come together, each brings psalm, teaching, revelation, tongues, or interpretation. Let everything be done for edification.
If anyone speaks in tongues, let two speak, or at most three, and in turn, and one interpret;
but if there is no interpreter, let him remain silent in the church and speak for himself and for God.
And let two or three prophets speak, and the others judge.
But if something is revealed to another who is sitting, the first one keeps silent.
Because you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone learns and everyone is exhorted.
The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
for God is not the God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
Women keep silent in the churches, because they are not allowed to speak, but rather, they are subject as the law also says.
And if you want to learn something, ask your own husbands at home; because it is not correct for women to speak in church.
Did the word of God come from you, or has it only come to you?
If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, recognize that what I am writing to you is the commandment of the Lord.
But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
Therefore, my brothers, long to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
But let everything be done decently and in order.
