Paul, Silvano and Timoteo: To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We always have to thank God for you, brothers, as is fair, because your faith increases greatly, and the love of each one of you towards others abounds more and more;
so that we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God, for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all the persecutions and afflictions that you endure.
This is an evident sign of God's just judgment, so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are truly suffering.
For after all, it is right before God to give affliction to those who afflict you,
and give relief to you who are afflicted, and also to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flame of fire,
giving retribution to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
These will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, excluded from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,
when He comes to be glorified in his saints on that day and to be admired among all who have believed; because our testimony has been believed by you.
To this end we also always pray for you, so that our God considers you worthy of your calling and fulfills every desire for goodness and the work of faith, with power,
so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
