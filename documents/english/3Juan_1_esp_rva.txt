The old man to the much loved Gaius, whom I truly love.
Beloved, my prayer is that you prosper in all things and have health, just as your soul prospers.
Well, I was very happy when brothers came and bore witness to your truth, that is, how you walk in the truth.
I have no greater joy than hearing that my children walk in the truth.
Beloved, you faithfully proceed in everything you do on behalf of the brothers, and even more so when they are outsiders.
In the presence of the church they have testified of your love. If you guide them as they are worthy of God, you will do well;
because they left for the name's sake without taking anything from the Gentiles.
Therefore, we must sustain such so that we are collaborators in the truth.
I have written to the church; but Diotrephes, who aspires to be the first among them, does not admit us.
For this reason, if I go there, I will remember the works he does and how he denigrates us with malicious words. Not satisfied with this, he himself does not admit the brothers; Furthermore, it prevents those who want to receive them and expels them from the church.
Beloved, do not imitate what is bad but what is good. He who does good comes from God, but he who does evil has not seen God.
Good testimony about Demetrius has been given by all and even for the same truth. We also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.
I had many things to write to you, but I don't want to do it with ink and pen.
Rather, I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.
Peace be with you. Friends greet you. Say hello to friends, each by name.
