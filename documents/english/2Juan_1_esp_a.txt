The old man to the chosen lady and her children, whom I truly love, and not only me, but also all who know the truth,
because of the truth that remains in us and that will be with us forever:
Grace, mercy and peace will be with us, from God the Father and Jesus Christ, Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I was very happy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we have received a command from the Father.
And now I beg you, madam, not as writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment as you have heard it from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. That is the deceiver and the antichrist.
Take care that you do not lose what we have achieved, but receive abundant rewards.
Everyone who deviates and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God; He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him at home, nor greet him,
for the one who greets him participates in his evil deeds.
Although I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do it with paper and ink, but I hope to go to you and speak face to face, so that your joy is complete.
The children of your chosen sister greet you.
