But as for you, teach what agrees with sound doctrine:
The elderly must be sober, worthy, prudent, healthy in faith, in love, in perseverance.
Likewise, old women must be reverent in their conduct: not slanderers or slaves of much wine, who teach the good,
to teach young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be prudent, pure, hardworking at home, kind, subject to their husbands, so that the word of God is not blasphemed.
Likewise, he exhorts young people to be prudent;
show yourself in everything as an example of good works, with purity of doctrine, with dignity,
with a healthy and irreproachable word, so that the adversary is ashamed of not having anything bad to say about us.
He exhorts servants to submit to their masters in everything, to be accommodating, not contradicting,
not defrauding, but showing all good faith, so that they adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all respects.
Because the grace of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all men,
teaching us, that denying impiety and worldly desires, we live in this world soberly, justly and piously,
waiting for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his possession, jealous of good works.
This speaks, exhorts and rebukes with all authority. Let no one belittle you.
